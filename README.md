LangChain 實驗
這個程式庫專注於使用 LangChain 庫進行實驗，利用大型語言模型（LLM）建立強大的應用程序。通過利用最先進的語言模型（如 OpenAI 的 GPT-3.5 Turbo，以及即將推出的 GPT-4），該項目展示了如何從 YouTube 視頻轉錄中創建可搜索的數據庫，使用 FAISS 庫執行相似性搜索查詢，並通過相關而精確的信息回答用戶的問題。

LangChain 是一個全面的框架，專門設計用於開發由語言模型驅動的應用程序。它不僅僅是通過 API 調用 LLM，而最先進和有區別的應用程序還具有數據感知和代理能力，使語言模型能夠連接其他數據源並與其環境交互。LangChain 框架專門建立用於解決這些原則。

索引：結合自定義文本數據與 LLMs 以增強其功能。
鏈：調用序列，無論是調用 LLM 還是不同的實用程序，都具有標準接口、集成和端到端鏈示例。
代理：作出行動決策、觀察結果並重複這個過程直到完成的 LLM，具有標準接口、代理選擇和端到端代理示例。


LangChain Experiments
This repository focuses on experimenting with the LangChain library for building powerful applications with large language models (LLMs). By leveraging state-of-the-art language models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo (and soon GPT-4), this project showcases how to create a searchable database from a YouTube video transcript, perform similarity search queries using the FAISS library, and respond to user questions with relevant and precise information.

LangChain is a comprehensive framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It goes beyond merely calling an LLM via an API, as the most advanced and differentiated applications are also data-aware and agentic, enabling language models to connect with other data sources and interact with their environment. The LangChain framework is specifically built to address these principles.

LangChain
The Python-specific portion of LangChain's documentation covers several main modules, each providing examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules include:

Models: Various model types and model integrations supported by LangChain.
Prompts: Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.
Memory: State persistence between chain or agent calls, including a standard memory interface, memory implementations, and examples of chains and agents utilizing memory.
Indexes: Combining LLMs with custom text data to enhance their capabilities.
Chains: Sequences of calls, either to an LLM or a different utility, with a standard interface, integrations, and end-to-end chain examples.
Agents: LLMs that make decisions about actions, observe the results, and repeat the process until completion, with a standard interface, agent selection, and end-to-end agent examples.
Use Cases
With LangChain, developers can create various applications, such as customer support chatbots, automated content generators, data analysis tools, and intelligent search engines. These applications can help businesses streamline their workflows, reduce manual labor, and improve customer experiences.

Service
By selling LangChain-based applications as a service to businesses, you can provide tailored solutions to meet their specific needs. For instance, companies can benefit from customizable chatbots that handle customer inquiries, personalized content creation tools for marketing, or internal data analysis systems that harness the power of LLMs to extract valuable insights. The possibilities are vast, and LangChain's flexible framework makes it the ideal choice for developing and deploying advanced language model applications in diverse industries.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
LangChain library
OpenAI API key
SerpAPI API Key
OpenAI API Models
The OpenAI API is powered by a diverse set of models with different capabilities and price points. You can also make limited customizations to our original base models for your specific use case with fine-tuning.

Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-experiments.git

2. Create a Python environment
Python 3.6 or higher using venv or conda. Using venv:

cd langchain-experiments
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
Using conda:


cd langchain-experiments
conda create -n langchain-env python=3.8
conda activate langchain-env


3. Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up the keys in a .env file
First, create a .env file in the root directory of the project. Inside the file, add your OpenAI API key:

makefile
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Save the file and close it. In your Python script or Jupyter notebook, load the .env file using the following code:

python

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
By using the right naming convention for the environment variable, you don't have to manually store the key in a separate variable and pass it to the function. The library or package that requires the API key will automatically recognize the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable and use its value.

When needed, you can access the OPENAI_API_KEY as an environment variable:

python

import os
api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
Now your Python environment is set up, and you can proceed with running the experiments
