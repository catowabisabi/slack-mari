  "dialogue": "Hello everyone, I am a sweeping monk!, Finally wait until the whole world is selling dollars!, It also means that wealth will usher in a real reshuffle!, No matter whether you were rich or not,, if you exchange your dollars for gold now, it may be your chance to get rich once in a lifetime!, Many people don't care about politics, thinking it's complicated and has nothing to do with them!, But let me ask you, is making money related to you?, All opportunities to make money are to see if you can understand the general environment, and then follow the trend!, So listen carefully! Very simple!, In the past, we didn't dare to say four words aloud, called de-dollarization!, Because we all know that countries that oppose the hegemony of the US dollar will not end well!, For example, the Japanese economy has been lost for 30 years and has not yet recovered!, Greece is directly bankrupt!, Countless countries seem to be scumbags by scumbags, and they are willing to be scumbags!, And the routine of these capitalists is called shearing sheep!, Use this trick every time! Very simple!, First of all, like at the beginning of the epidemic in 20 years, the capitalists of, the Federal Reserve made it clear that the economy was not good and wanted to stimulate the economy!, So put watermarked banknotes crazily, more money! Then your money will become less and less valuable. At the same time, , the interest rate, which is the cost of borrowing money, will become very low!, At this time, those rich people, big companies, big banks, and even the government of a country will, borrow money to invest and do business!, Then a large amount of U.S. dollars will flow into the market, and prices will rise, entering the era of inflation., The stock market , the currency market, and even NFT are all skyrocketing!, At that time, among the four Asian tigers, Vietnam was able to flourish for a while, all because of the release of water by the Federal Reserve!, OK! Your wool has grown!, When your entire economic bubble reaches its limit!, The Federal Reserve said, I will not release water!, Since 22 last year, the Federal Reserve has directly announced interest rate hikes in the name of fighting inflation!, Just to tell you, the economy is so turbulent and unstable, don't invest in business!, You put your dollars on my side and I will give you great interest!, In this way, people all over the world who bought bitcoin stocks sold these investment products, and put them in the bank with US dollars!, At this time, the stocks and assets of outstanding companies in your country will collapse! Not worth the money anymore!, Not only that, our dollar has appreciated, and your things are cheaper in disguise., Our capitalists can use the money from the appreciation to buy your cheap assets!, So you can find that the process of raising interest rates only lasted for about half a year to a year. The capitalists of, the Federal Reserve are slowly buying the assets of your country to buy the bottom!, And the so-called experts in your own country come out and say that house prices, are going to collapse, the stock market is going to collapse, , scaring you to sell your assets as soon as possible, and hold cash!, The result is that history keeps reappearing. Every time ordinary people sell their houses when house prices fall and buy houses when, house prices rise, they are sheared again and again!, So at this time, some countries think,, anyway, in the end, the assets of our people will be bought up by those capitalists in the United States, , and all the money we earn will go to those capitalists. In, disguise , ordinary people can only work for these capitalists for the rest of their, lives, so why don’t we How about a fight?, So you have recently heard that, many countries such as China, Russia, Argentina, India, Brazil, etc., have come out to say that they will no longer trade in US dollars, , and banks in many countries, have bought a lot of gold in a very low-key way! Cause the price of gold to skyrocket!, Well, as mentioned in previous videos, I would buy gold not for investment, but as a hedge against financial crisis and war!, And recently, I discovered that gold is full of speculative value!, For ordinary people, it may be a chance to stand up, and the routine is very easy to catch!, Then I spent a lot of time making this, video to take you on a journey of thought, . If you don’t support me, it’s easy to like it. If I don’t do it, in the future , no one will do it!, And this channel is dedicated to cultivating bosses, investors, and rich people., If you don't want to miss this information, , you can subscribe to my channel for free, like other brothers and sisters who are close to 500,000 , and then turn on the little bell!, First of all, why do we rarely hear that someone investing in gold will make a lot of money?, Because you can understand that gold is a substitute for the dollar. When the dollar is strong, these years, gold will be weak!, Then why does the Federal Reserve keep printing money? The dollar should have no value at all., Why can it still have hegemony everywhere?, Because those capitalist elites have come up with a plan to control the world , which is to, find a valuable commodity, and tie the worthless dollar with it!, That's worth the dollar! We won’t be afraid of inflation,, and we will be able to be aboveboard and print as much money as we want, right?, So what kind of goods are valuable?, If all countries want to develop, they must use oil!, Oil is the blood of industry! But the United States is not a big oil country!, So they found Saudi Arabia with a lot of oil production on the map, and forced Saudi Arabia to become their little brother, through bribery and intimidation, so that they can only buy and sell oil with US dollars., That is, if, you go to Saudi Arabia to buy oil today, , you must first change the currency into You can only buy it with US dollars!, Then it is not enough for a Saudi to be a younger brother, so through the Middle East war, most of the oil countries in the Middle East are, forced to trade oil with US dollars!, Another method is the human rights war, supporting some opposition groups and engaging in cultural aggression!, What does that mean? Once these countries want to leave the control of the United States,, the United States will launch so-called human rights warnings, . At least they will be kicked out of the international community, and at worst they will start a war., Just to tell you, if you don’t listen to me, you will bear the consequences!, If you are obedient and be my younger brother, I, the boss, will continue to lead you to make money!, Then you don't have to choose, just join if you can't beat it, and make money together!, These younger brothers also made a lot of money following the bankers in the United States!, At this time, these bankers told the younger brother, do you want to make more money?, The younger brother said: think about it! That's OK! You give me the money you earn, and I'll give you interest!, So my younger brother invested all his money in the US financial market!, And these capitalists use the money to lend usury and lend it to countries that are eager to use the money!, Use money to make you my slave! What does that mean?, Suppose you are the boss of a country, and you want to have political achievements, and a good development of the country, but you have no money, no oil, and, no industry development, so what should you do?, At this time, our American capitalists came over and told you that, I can lend you money, and I asked my little brother country to sell oil to you!, Just pay it back on time!, Then there are only two roads for you, the first is to continue to be poor, and then be suppressed by the United States!, The second is to accept this condition and gamble on the chance to turn around!, But to be honest, there is no choice but to accept it!, Because other countries have accepted it. If you don’t accept it, they will all develop. If, you don’t develop, you will become weaker!, So invisibly, your, whole country has become the younger brother of our American capitalists, working for us!, If you can't pay back the money, your country's high-quality assets will be taken away by us!, If you develop, pay back the money!, After the high interest is earned by us,, we will start to suppress you again, blockade you in trade, , support your domestic opposition, and intervene in you!, So many people think that the US dollar is the currency! In fact, the dollar is just a currency!, Goods are commodities and resources, such as houses, cars, and even pearl milk tea are all goods!, And what the Fed capitalists play is to exchange coins for your goods! What does that mean?, When you have to use U.S. dollars for transactions,, for example, if you want to buy oil today, , then you must have enough U.S. dollars to pay countries in the Middle East!, In this way, you must hoard US dollars to maintain your exchange rate stability!, And today you have hoarded 10 billion dollars, but you don’t use them here, then these dollars are actually worthless!, Just a bunch of scrap paper, right?, However, you actually have to exchange your own products and resources for the waste paper, you hoard !, In other words, you exchange some worthless waste paper with something of actual value!, Why do you say this is waste paper?, Because there is basically no cost to print this waste paper,, just a few printing machines, and it can be printed at any time! Can you understand?, Just when you thought it was over, the capitalists of the Federal Reserve came up and said, bro!, Do you want to make money?, In fact, you don’t need to hold so many U.S. dollars., Your 10 billion can be used to buy the national bonds we issued!, We are here in the United States, and we will not run away., Therefore, the national debt we issue is the most reliable and the safest investment!, Then you give me ten billion dollars, and I will give you an IOU!, Usually you put this money with me, and I promise you a time limit! Let's say ten years!, Then ten years later, I will return the money to you, and I will pay you additional interest!, Then if you agree, you buy 10 billion ten-year U.S. bonds, , then the capitalists of the Federal Reserve will immediately receive 10 billion cash!, Then they will use the tens of billions to, buy the resources and assets of your country!, This is a typical white wolf with empty gloves!, I borrow money from you to buy your things, and I don't have to spend a penny myself!, I will pay you back the money, but I will not pay it back in ten years!, So what about ten years from now? I will still pay you back the 10 billion with interest, how can I pay you back?, I used the same routine to borrow money from other countries!, It is equivalent to repaying old debts with new debts!, So why are Americans so rich?, Remember this sentence, the poor are in heaven, and the money is in the bank!, And the rich are people in heaven, and their debts are in the bank!, The United States, the number one economy in the world, tells you that, the rich drive a Lamborghini and borrow the money that the poor have deposited in the bank!, The Federal Reserve owes countless debts to the whole world. The fruits of hard work, of other countries are replaced by a piece of waste paper!, This is the dollar hegemony, a system that makes most people in the world their slaves, and work for them! What kind of feeling is this?, It's as if you thought you bought a million regular financial management!, But that financial manager fooled you and bought all the million in lottery tickets!, During the 2008 financial crisis,, American capitalists invented a very high-risk financial product and sold it to the whole world!, Then it blew up! More than 4 trillion U.S. dollars are involved, and they can't be recovered!, Any country will not be able to get up if this kind of thing happens, , such as the tulip bubble, and the fall of the British Empire!, But it only took two years for the United States to get up, why?, Because he can print unlimited money 24 hours a day, and let people all over the world pay for him!, Then lend money to their local businesses to help them tide over the storm!, When the U.S. economy recovers, these companies will return the money they earn to the Federal Reserve!, The capitalists of the Federal Reserve can continue, to buy their high-quality assets in other countries whose economies have not yet recovered !, The most ridiculous thing is that other countries still dare not speak out, because you need oil if you want to develop, and if you need oil, you, have to exchange your rice for dollars!, And when the Fed keeps printing money, the more it prints, the less valuable, your dollars are, and the waste paper is more like waste paper!, At this time, you can oppose them!, That is to fight against them, and the end is a human rights warning!, So in fact, I have no choice but to swallow my breath and smile!, Over time, you have nothing to eat, and when you are about to starve to death,, the United States will donate a little food to you. It is said to be humanitarian aid,, but in fact it is to keep you alive and continue to make money for him! Then you have to thank him!, But there is no way, whoever is powerful and smart can make the rules of the game!, This world is a capitalist society, and wealth is controlled by smart elites!, You can't expect others to help you, because the government may be the victim!, Your own wealth can only be protected by yourself!, So many people messaged me privately, saying that they want to get rid of this, fate . Those who study can’t see the future, and those who, go to work have endless cycles., It seems that no matter what you do, you are messing around. Looking at, 2023, one-third of the time has passed, and there is still no way to break through! what to do?, I tell you! In the world of self-media, if you finish making a film today, , if there are still people watching the film 10 years later, , then you will earn a full 10 years of passive income!, Fans will be the biggest asset now and in the future!, Because when you master fans, you are choking the neck of businessmen, and, they need to find you to cooperate if they need to expose their products!, And why, can my disciples and I, earn 7-figure dollars a year when large companies around the world lay off employees, banks collapse, stock markets and currency markets collapse, and the real business cannot continue due to the epidemic?, It is because what my disciples, see in the crisis is not a danger, but an opportunity, to build a business through self-media that makes customers chase us!, What we are playing is that YouTube has 2.5 billion people., If everyone gives you a piece to buy your product or service, you will have 2.5 billion!, Let me tell you, entrepreneurship can be learned, and it is also a science that can be replicated and practiced! why?, Because I have, summarized our entire set of business secrets and paths in the latest training camp in 2023!, I want to ask! How much are you willing to pay for this training camp that can change your destiny?, The value of this training camp is $300!, But today, as long as you like this video! I will make you this friend!, You don't need 300, 200, 100, not even 1 dollar!, right! Do not say anything! Let you watch for free! Also give you a gift!, So hurry up and sign up at the first link on the video description!, After signing up, you can watch this video first, and then watch it slowly!, But now, after many countries have been sheared again and again, they can't bear it anymore!, do you know? In the past three years, the epidemic and energy problems, have brought a huge debt crisis to the United States, . If you understand it this way, GDP is the income of the United States, . Now the U.S. debt is 126% of GDP. This figure was insolvent, at that time in Greece and Argentina. And so on, the countries have experienced it, , and then these countries have a large-scale economic crisis, , so now the creditor countries that lend money to the United States are panicked., It is the United States, if you continue to play like this, if you go bankrupt one day,, you owe me. Is the money not paid back at all?, We can see that the U.S. sanctions on Russia, have directly blocked a large number of Russia’s overseas assets, , and you may not know that these assets include a lot of U.S. treasury bonds., This operation directly stunned other countries. What’s going on?, One day I will stop cooperating with you, will you also block my U.S. debt?, You don't have to pay back the money you owe, it's too dangerous!, I have to sell this U.S. debt first, and then forget about it in exchange for money!, So this led to a wave of U.S. debt selling!, So when these countries got their money back, they, originally wanted to take advantage of the Fed’s interest rate hikes and deposit their money in banks to earn interest, . Now that Silicon Valley Bank has closed down, these countries almost couldn’t get any money., Then they finally got their money back and put it in Switzerland. Over there, Credit Suisse fell as a result!, Such a large sum of money cannot be depreciated in the warehouse, let, alone investing in high-risk assets, such as oil, stocks, etc. So, we can only return to our original heart, and everyone is rushing to buy gold!, How crazy is this? Put it this way!, Since 2022, the central banks of many countries have secretly bought gold, , and they are all robbed by tons!, In just over a year, 1,200 tons were, bought, a record high in 55 years, . Everyone knows that the supply of gold is limited. For example, , there are only 100 gold pieces in the world, and the country hoards 80 pieces, and the remaining 20 pieces, are in stock . Is it very popular in the market? So the price of gold keeps rising!, Then the question that everyone is most concerned about is whether, ordinary people can earn the first pot of gold in their lives by buying gold this time?, Many people's impression of investing in gold is that the return is extremely low and the volatility is extremely large!, In the past 100 years, the average annualized rate of return of gold is only 4.6%, which is, far lower than the performance of the US stock index,, and the average annualized fluctuation is 15.2%, which is also much higher than the US stock index, . Is this really the case? If you want to see the trend of gold price, you have to look at it in two stages!, The first stage was before 1971, gold was used as currency, and all countries used gold as a reserve!, At that time, you were holding US dollars (a slip of the tongue), and I was holding Japanese yen, . So whose national currency is more valuable?, How do we calculate the exchange rate? How to trade?, At this time, it depends on how much gold your country reserves!, Whoever reserves more gold will issue banknotes with higher gold content and more valuable banknotes., This is the gold standard system!, At that time, the United States held the most gold, so it said that its US dollar was directly linked to gold,, and other countries in the world do not need to hold gold,, just hold our US dollars!\nJust hold our US dollars!, This is the first stage, the era of the gold standard!, Gold exists in the form of world currency!, But from 1971 to now, the gameplay is different!, When the whole world holds U.S. dollars, the capitalists of the Federal Reserve will tell you, that anyway , you don’t usually hold U.S. dollars and exchange them for gold with me!, Therefore, the Fed directly canceled the gold standard!, It means that everyone recognizes the U.S. dollar, no longer because it has enough gold reserves, , but because they recognize the United States as, a country. It doesn’t matter whether you have gold. Anyway, I believe in your country., At this time, the properties of gold will completely change, . It no longer exists as a currency attribute, but an asset attribute!, It is no different from other silver elements!, So after you listen to it, you may dislike gold even more!, Because it's degraded, it was a currency recognized around the world, and now it's just an ordinary precious metal, right?, He does not give you dividends and interest like stocks , nor, does he give you rental income like real estate! Then it is even more impossible to buy it!, But if you look at the trend of gold seriously, , before 1971, the price of gold was in a straight line, neither rising nor falling!, And when it was no longer a world currency, that is, after 1971,, it had an explosive increase! Why?, Because during the gold standard, it is a currency and a tool,, and it cannot fluctuate too much! Can you understand?, When the gold standard is abolished and gold is no longer a currency, but a tangible asset, people will speculate and collect it!, In addition, people are increasingly distrusting the dollar, so there will be an upward trend!, Therefore, if we really look at the data of gold, we, must look at it from the time when the gold standard was abolished in 1971 and gold had investment properties!, Then from 1971 to 2000, the average annualized rate of return for these 29 years was 6.8%!, Then 2000 entered a new century!, So until 2023, the annual rate of return for these 23 years exceeds 10%!, Isn't this a higher rate of return than buying any financial management, even stock index funds?, As I said, I have always had the habit of collecting gold, , but I am not for investment, but to listen to the words of \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\", and deploy gold as a safe-haven asset!, But now I find that I have held it for so many years, , especially the daily wars in the past few days, . I asked my mother to buy more gold bars in Hong Kong. It was bought for more than 1,700 US dollars on August 2, 22, , and now it has risen to 2,000. Dollar!, Then I made around $1500 per bar!, For about 9 months, the rate of return is 15%!, honestly! Compared with our previous shorting of the yen, earning several times and several times, the return is really not much!, I wasn't going to sell the gold either!, I just love hoarding gold bars and real estate! My strategy is to live with rare goods!, Hearing this, some people questioned it!, If the annual return has been more than 10% in the past 23 years, , then why do those aunts in China lose money buying gold?, First of all, what Chinese aunts buy is not gold bars and nuggets, but jewelry!, It's a gold chain for your wedding. The bracelet is beautiful, isn't it?, There are dragons and phoenixes, and there are processing fees in them!, There is a huge premium, and you will lose money once you buy it!, Then, we said that the 23-year average annual return is 10%,, and we are standing now to look back and settle the accounts!, This does not mean that there is a fixed 10% return every year!, For example, if you lost 5% last year, I earned 25% this year, so, the average annual rate of return for a total of 20% in the past two years is 10%! Can you understand?, People who don't understand investment think that investment is like a bank-guaranteed wealth management product that gives you a fixed income, every year ! In fact, investments are subject to fluctuations., For example, in 2003, you bought gold with US$100,000 and held it for 10 years, . By 2013, you can get back more than 450,000, which is a 4.5-fold increase in 10 years! Earn about 16% per year!, But if you bought gold in 2013 and sold it at the beginning of 2019,, you would lose money, a loss of almost 1%!, But if you buy it in 19 years, sell it in 20 years, and hold it for one year, you will earn 20%!, Can you understand? You want to make money in a short period of time. Buying and selling, is called trading, and it is called speculation! Then you risk losing money!, But you don’t plan to sell it after you buy it., You hold it for 10 years and 8 years, and then you look back, oh!, It turns out that your profit has doubled! Right?, But I still don't sell it! Because the time when the value of gold is the highest, is when many people jump off buildings during the financial crisis, or even when there is a war!, And even if these things don't happen in my lifetime, I, can leave it to my children and grandchildren! Do not sell!, Anyway, the book value of gold has risen., Even if I am waiting to use the money now, if I sell it, I will still make money!, So if I don't wait to use the money now, I will put it in a safe place and not sell it,, so what does it matter?, At least I think any insurance is not as safe as buying gold!, Your financial crisis, the insurance company will go bankrupt, , but my holding gold can even let me rise a few ranks, from a businessman to an aristocrat, right?, So if you hoard gold for a long time and buy it if you have spare money, there must be no problem!, Because for me, I'd rather buy gold than buy too much insurance!, And if you are a person who wants to make quick money, but feels that playing futures, stocks, and Bitcoin is too risky!, Let me tell you, gold is also an asset that is relatively easy to catch trends and allow you to make quick money!, You only need to know its core value, which is to avoid risks and preserve value!, When human beings have a great demand for hedging and value preservation, the price of gold will rise!, You go and see! The rally in gold started in August 2018, when the price was around $1,100. What happened at that time?, It is the friction of the Sino-US trade war that has begun to escalate!, Until March 2020, the price of gold rose to $1455!, Look again! In the next 5 months, it skyrocketed!, It has been rising to an all-time high of $2070., Let me ask you, what happened from March to August 2020?, The epidemic appeared and caused panic all over the world, right, ? Then after August, the good news begins to come out!, Everyone began to discover that our human fears are actually greater than the real situation, . You think that this epidemic is incurable, , but later you find out that it is not as terrible as you imagined., Everyone has been infected by this virus and is used to it, . Vaccines have also begun It was developed, and then the new US president took office., Everyone thought that he might put down the trade war, so the price of gold began to fall!, Until 22, the Federal Reserve said it would raise interest rates, and a large amount of funds would return to the United States, , so the dollar strengthened again, and the price of gold fell again!, Have you discovered the underlying logic of gold's rise and fall?, When the world is full of good news and everyone is sure about the future,, people are more inclined to hold cash, and the price of gold will fall!, Conversely, when the world is full of negative news and you, go out on the street and everyone is panicking and complaining about the government, , the price of gold will go up!, You see now, big companies are laying off employees, banks are closing down, fearing war, and then being sheared by the United States, so the price of gold has risen!, Moreover, many countries no longer use US dollars for transactions, and directly call for dollarization!, The dollar starts to weaken! Gold has risen to a historical high, which is more than 2,000 US dollars!, Look at this picture, the green one is a very obvious pressure line!, That is, every time the price of gold reaches the highest level here, someone will short it!, So it will fall back! Has been unable to break through!, And now, the price of gold has returned to a similar position., It has been unable to rise, but it has not fallen, but is sideways!, What does this mean? It means that there is enough strength to take orders and support the price of gold!, Whether it is a large investor or a retail investor, many people are buying gold!, At this time, if you want to speculate, you should pay attention., If the price of gold breaks through the green pressure line, , that is, the price of gold rises above 2,070 US dollars, it means that there is no selling above the price of, gold , and everyone who buys gold It is profitable!, At this time, gold may usher in an unprecedented surge!, Pay attention! Then our method is very simple, , that is, if the price of gold breaks through the green pressure line, which is 2070 US dollars, , we will automatically buy gold ETF, or other derivative products, or even, buy gold bars directly like me!, Then set the stop loss above the green line , because, after this pressure line is broken, it will become a support line!, As long as we buy and fall below the support line of 2070 US dollars again,, which means that it may be washed, we will sell, tie, and lose a little handling fee!, But if after buying, there is no selling pressure from above, and our, rate of return may be unprecedentedly high if it keeps skyrocketing !, This is the strategy of speculation. If you lose, you will lose only one candy., If you win , you will win a villa. Do you understand?, So if we can't break through this green pressure line, we just don't buy it!, But why should we keep paying attention?, Because the Fed's shearing has come to an end, the Fed will stop raising interest rates!, look! Banks in the United States have all failed, , so they even said that they will soon announce an interest rate cut and continue to print money,, and the dollar will weaken at that time! Gold will be stronger!, So gold will have a wave of gains, is it reasonable?, However, if you clearly know that now is an opportunity to make a wave of quick money, , but you have no bargaining chips, and you cannot afford gold, , then you can only helplessly miss this opportunity!, In fact, the most profitable investment in the world is to invest in yourself!, Your brain is your greatest asset because it can come up with countless ways to make money!, And if you are like me at the beginning, you have nothing,, no connections, background, funds, and even student loan debts, . What you really need is not to learn about investment and financial management first, but to have an automated business, that allows you to collect money while you sleep!, Many people have no time to invest in order to go to work, and they don't even have the opportunity to learn!, Moreover, their salaries are fixed, so it's useless for you to pray for luck!, The most important thing is that many people in this world are still in the physical industry, let me tell you!, If your industry cannot appear in the Internet, you will be eliminated soon!, Just like the newspaper industry, which has a history of a hundred years, it is impossible to go bankrupt, right?, As a result, who will read physical newspapers now? Everyone is watching the news on their phones, right?, In the past, everyone would advertise on the street., Now the place where the advertising industry makes the most money is the self-media platforms such as Youtube!, If you still don't know how to make money,, you really must be the first link to sign up for my 2023 training camp!, free!
