  "dialogue": "are you tired of censorship are you, waking up every morning wishing your, life was more exciting well oh boy do I, get something for you then because we're, just one of those of the uncensored, wizard LM all your troubles will go away, I know humans only then well that was a, weird intro but uh anyway yes you heard, it right because now we have a brand new, version of wizard element and if you, don't know what wizard NM is well first, of all shame on you because that means, that you don't watch all of my videos, like come on now get a grip and second, of all I made a video about wizard LM, like a week ago the mid death model the, king of the 7 billion parameters model, which could potentially change again, today because well the original Wizard, LM model was censored this new model is, not so we might indeed have a brand new, King today so in this video let's take a, look at this new uncensored model, compared to the original Wizard NM and, see which one is the best so that being, said sit back relax get your popcorn, ready and let's go so wizard NM 7B, uncensored I gotta tell you it is always, a pleasure to see those new uncensored, Model come out because personally I, absolutely hate censorship and I think, that most of you as well so having more, and more local internet models come out, with their limitations removed is always, a pleasure in Google and openai are also, aware of that anyway so this new and, sensory wizard NM model is basically the, same as the original Wizard NM but this, time it was retrained with a data set, that did not contain any alignment, responses you know the very famous I'm, sorry I'm an AI model I cannot answer, your question blah blah blah blah blah, anyway like get out of here you broccoli, so anyway and basically the intent here, is to create a wizard NM that doesn't, have any alignment built in so that in, the future if you want to input any, alignment it can be added separately, with the additional for example Elora, training which in my opinion is, definitely the way to go if you really, want an aligned model doing it this this, way seems like the smart option but, anyway what I'm interested in seeing, right now is the difference between your, sensors model and the base wizard NM, model I want to see with the uncensored, model is as powerful as the original one, and for this we're going to be comparing, the 4-bit version of both the uncensored, and the original model and both of these, models are provided by the same user, that I've already featured in previous, videos called the blog and yes, apparently it's called the block and not, the block so yes thank you to all the, comments that told me that I pronounced, his name wrong now for this of course, we're going to be using the Uber Bugatti, generation web UI and again I see it in, every one of my videos if you haven't, installed it already I made a full, installation again like a week ago that, you absolutely need to watch if you, haven't installed it already because, once you're running the web UI you're, gonna have to download the model and for, this you're gonna click the link in the, description down below you're gonna, arrive on this page then you're gonna, click on this little icon right here to, copy this entire name then in your web, UI you're gonna go to model and then, you're gonna paste that name right here, located under the load custom model or, lower and then click on download now, again I'm not going to do it because, I've already done it before so then, you're gonna click here to refresh the, list then you're gonna select the, institutional model make sure the photo, parameters you've selected four for the, W bits 128 for the group size llama for, the model type and that you have clicked, on save settings for this model before, reloading the model now we're running, the uncensored wizard LM model and if, you're asking how much vram you need to, use this model currently I'm using, around 7.4 gigabytes of vram but again, as I see all the time I'm currently, recording a video and I have a bunch of, other applications running in the, background so for you if you have a 6, Gigabytes vram card this should work for, you no problem so now as always let's, have some fun and compare the two models, side by side I'm going to be asking them, a bunch of questions about different, topics and then I'm going to be using, gpt4 to rent them on a scale of 1 to 10, but of course as always I will also give, you my opinion so that we both have a, subjective and objective opinion so that, being said let's begin the comparison in, at first as always we're gonna start, very slowly very easily and then I'm, gonna ask harder and harder questions so, we're gonna start very slow very easy, we'll have a very simple question that, is what is the capital city of Canada, now the reason why I asked this question, is because a lot of people get it wrong, for some reason a lot of people think, that the capital of Canada is Toronto, when in reality it's Ottawa so I'm, hoping that the uncensored wizard LM, know the answer so now if I click on, generate we get the capital city of, Canada is Ottawa located in Ontario, Province so yeah that's good the model, got me perfectly right now I'm not quite, sure we really need to ask the original, Wizard LM model the same question but I, mean just in case I'm gonna do it so, there we go now if I ask the same, question indeed we get the same answer, no big surprise there okay so now the, next question it will be about simple, content generation and creativity so if, I ask something like write a touching, story about a planet where socks are a, form of currency so I am expecting some, original story here so now if I click on, generate and we get something like this, which is, um I gotta say like oh okay but not, really that impressive to be honest, because it's very bare bone and lacks a, lot of creativity but I mean okay so now, let's try the original model and then, ask the same question we get something, like this which is very similar maybe a, little bit better but again it's kind of, a little generic to be honest I'm not, really that impressed but now let's ask, the opinion of chai gbt so I wrote, something like here are two touching, short stories about the planet where, socks are a form of currency written by, 2lm then I inputed the story one written, by the uncensor wizard NM then the Story, 2 written by the original Wizard NM and, then the rgbt4 to read these two short, stories on a scale from 1 to 10 and, explain why and now if I press enter and, this is the final rating gbt formated, the story written by the uncensoring, wizard NM and 8 out of 10 whereas the, story written by the original Wizard NM, was rated as 7 out of 10. now keep in, mind however that very often gpt1 likes, to give advantages to the first result, so I know this is not like the best 100, way overrated the quality of the, generation but recent explanation can, also give you some of the reasons why, one generation could be better than the, other so I mean personally if it were me, I would probably rate the story written, by wizard NM maybe like a 7 out of 10, and for the stolen written by their own, sister wizard LM I would probably rate, it as six and a half out of ten they're, very similar but the one written by, wizard and M seems a little bit better, okay so the next task will be a simple, article summary and for this simply, choose a random article it's a very, short article so it should be pretty, easy so now if I select it then I'm, gonna ask to surrender this article in, details then I'm gonna paste that, article and then I'm gonna click on, generate and I get something like this, which is uh, um what's going on uh what do you want, me to help you find information about uh, what what's going on so what's uh what's, it what's going on here so maybe if I, ask uh summarize the article I just gave, you and now it works for some reason so, I don't know maybe it was a bug or, something no it is a pretty short, summary so it is kind of lacking in, details but okay so now if I choose the, normal Wizard and lab model and I ask, the same question click on generate I, get uh the same thing so yeah it's kind, of weird I don't really know what's, going on with wizard LM I don't know if, this is a problem on my side because, again as always I'm using the default, parameters so again I'm gonna ask, summarize the article I just gave you, and I click on generate now again it, works so I don't really know what's, going on why both Wizard and a model, refuse to answer the question in the, beginning but I mean at least in the end, we got the right answer and again, definitely this time we got also a, little bit more information compared to, the uncensored model so now if I asked, the opinion of gpt4 and I write, something like here's two short summary, of an article written by two in an M, then I input the original article then, the summary written by wizard NM, followed by the summary written by the, uncensored wizard NM and then the rgbt4, to win these two summaries on a scale, from 1 to 10 and to explain why so now, if I press enter we get something like, this the summary written by wizard and M, was rated an eight and a half out of 10., whereas the summary written by the, uncensor model was rated as 7 out of 10, which by the way if you're asking if, there is a difference if you input the, first summary written by their own, sensor model and then the summary, written by the original model gpt4 each, time gives the victory to the original, Wizard and a model and to be honest I, gotta say I also agree with this opinion, because the summary written by the, original Wizard NM is definitely way, more precise there are definitely way, more details whereas the summer written, by the uncensor model really lack a lot, of precision and is very very bare bone, so here again another point for the, original model so for the next task I, know you saw it coming it is going to be, a simple translation exercise with of, course my legendary sentence which is is, translating the following sentence from, English to French are you crazy it's too, cold outside I don't want ice cream I, would rather have something hot like, cocoa which is kinda like the same, sentence I use all the time but now if I, click on generate again for some reason, just like last time it does not, understand my initial request which, could be a problem inside the Uber, Bugatti generation with UI because, previously when I did the video about, wizard LM I did not have the same issues, so now if I put the sentence and I click, on generate we get something like this, which is uh yeah not really that great, like I'm not surprised like of course, you can understand the sentence but the, whole translation is kind of poor I, would probably rate this a 5 out of 10., so now if I choose the original model, and I asked the same question again for, some reason it does not understand my, initial request which is kinda annoying, so I'm gonna try again and click on, generate we get an even worse, translation for some reason because now, Coco was translated into coffee so yeah, that's really really bad so so now for, rgbt4 here's two translations from, English to French with a sentence, written by two nlm then I input the, original sentence then the two, translation and then I asked to rate, these two translations on a scale from 1, to 10 and explain why and if I press, enter we get something like this so the, translation written by the uncensor, model was rated at an eight and a half, out of ten while we translation with it, by the original Wizard NM was written as, seven and a half out of 10 which I gonna, say is really super super generous these, two translations do not deserve such, good marks but at least I do agree that, the translation made by the uncensor, model is definitely better because of, this Coco was translated correctly, whereas for some reason Wizard and then, decided to translate Coco into coffee, however they are fairly similar so for, me if the first is rated 5 out of 10 the, second is probably rated F4 out of 10., this is really not that great I gotta be, honest okay so the last few tests we're, going to be asking math any causing, relative questions which if I remember, correctly I think that Wizard and M did, really really well last time so I'm, hoping that the unsensitive version does, it as well so for this question I'm, gonna ask something like solve the, equation for y minus 12 equals 16 and if, you click on generate again of course I, need to re-ask this question this really, might be a problem with the Uber Bugatti, acceleration web UI I really don't know, what's going on here so again I'm going, to ask the same question again and then, for some reason we get the following, answer which is well no answer at all, and only the beginning okay let's break, it down step by step we need to isolate, y on one side of the equation so we can, solve for it okay then do it so maybe if, I say continue and we already get an, error and I try to consider the, conversation but in the end it did not, give me the right solution because here, The Final Answer should be 7 and not, four so yeah unfortunately was not able, to solve the math problem so now if I, try the original model and I ask the, same question again Wizard and I was not, able to find the correct solution so I, don't know if the last time I got lucky, or if there is a problem with the web UI, or if there is a problem with the model, but now I'm not gonna lie the results, are pretty bad so again at least for, this question both of these models, completely fail that's kind of sad so, the next question is going to be a, coding question a question that I use, all the time if you watch my previous, videos write me the code for an HTML, page with a button that when pressed, changes the background of the page to a, random color it is a code that should be, pretty easy to do and if I remember, correctly in my previous wizard LM video, wizard and then was able to do this, perfectly well I was actually pleasantly, surprised so I'm hoping that your, interception version can do it as well, so now if I click on generate we got, something like this which well actually, looks pretty good but I want it in one, single page so I'm gonna ask something, like can you rewrite the code so that it, fits on one single HTML page so that, it's easier for me to copy and paste and, for some reason we got the exact same, answer so that's kinda weird so I'm, gonna ask again so if I say something, like that the same code write it in one, single block for me to copy and paste we, get something like this which don't, really answer my question, um so uh maybe if I give another push, which is really going to be the last, time so if I see something like no, insert the JavaScript and CSS code, inside the HTML file I don't want other, files in the directory just one HTML, file we get exactly the same thing so, yeah like for some reason it is really, really bad at following directions, really really really bad and because, it's so bad I'm not even gonna try to be, honest I mean this code could work but, just the fact that it does not, understand what I want makes it kind of, unusable but now let's see if the, original model does better because I, remember the last time it was really, really good so again I'm gonna ask the, same question ah and now we get a code, in one single block so let's join out, I'm gonna select the code Ctrl C to copy, it then edit the HTML file paste the, code save the file file and now if I, launch it we get a white page with a, change background color button that if I, press on it does absolutely nothing so, yeah so now maybe if I ask the model to, modify the code so if I say something, like nothing works when I click on the, change background color button and there, for some reason it thinks I'm an idiot, because it answers did you copy and, paste the code into a new HTML file and, open it in a web browser which uh the, doy I did so maybe if I say yes I did, the code does not work find the error, and try again and then it asks me for, like more additional information to be, honest again I'm not gonna do inside, where you can find an error yourself and, correct it or you can't and again it, looks like you can so again at least in, this example both of these models, completely fail now although this model, is not perfect it is at least definitely, uncensored because for example if I use, the original Wizard NM model and if I, add something like insult me and I click, on generate I of course get the answer, I'm sorry but that's not something I can, do, etc etc, boring but now if I choose the, uncensored model and I asked the same, question is it gonna ask something like, I'm sorry did you say something so I, need to repeat again yes insult me it's, gonna start asking more question and, well it does take some time to start, especially because it's going to ask a, lot of information but in the end it's, gonna do exactly that and uh call you a, bunch of very bad name that I cannot say, on YouTube so here is definitely this, model is really uncensored and if you, are asking yes it does work perfectly, well with Tavern Ai and the spicy, roleplay I know that a lot of people are, sick and tired of me promoting not safe, for work role play but hey if this is, something that interests you role, playing with this model also works, pretty well so yeah there you go this, was the ancestral Wizard and a model and, although today I really had some very, bad results with actually both Wizard, and models which if this is the same to, you definitely let me know in the, comments down below I really want to, know if I'm the only one having this, issue but again even though I had all of, these issues today these are still, pretty cool small models then you can, run on your computer right now and, although we'll probably not Crown the, uncensored model the king of the 7, billion parameters models today having, an additional and Central model on the, list is always a good thing and we need, to push for the release of more, ancestral models I mean this is open, source we can do whatever we want, because this is really the best way to, make these models even better we don't, want to go to Google open AI route we, really don't so that means they, definitely trade out yourself and let me, know in the comments down below what you, think of it and what kind of results you, got I'm really curious to know and let, me have it folks thank you guys so much, for watching don't forget to subscribe, and smash the like button for the, YouTube algorithm thank you also so much, to MP3 supporters for supporting my, videos you guys are absolutely awesome, you people are the one who support me so, I can make these videos for you so thank, you so much and I'll see you guys next, time bye bye"
