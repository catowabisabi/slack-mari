  "zh_paraphrase": " 我們今天要聊的是聊 Auto GPT，也就是 GPT 的升級版，它可以幫助我們在很短的時間內完成一些非常複雜的工作。例如，Solely 就用 Auto GPT 在不到三分鐘的時間內建立了一個網站，而且他強調結果非常讓人驚訝，以至於不再需要編碼了。Felipe 也有一個很有趣的例子，他使用 Auto GPT 來編寫程式碼，並且結合多個檔案，然後在之後他又調整了一些，使它更完善。Omar 則是使用它來進行業務招攬，他給它一個目標，就是我們是一個可以幫助你節省招聘面試時間的 SaaS，然後它就開始進行研究，收集所有的電子郵件和聯繫資訊，並且草擬一個發送給目標公司的郵件模板。Garrett 也在使用它，他建立了一個系統，每次新增任務時，Auto GPT 就會出現，它會擁有你和你的公司所需的背景資訊，並且可以訪問你的應用程式。Linus 也在使用它，他在玩 god mode，可以讓你在星巴克訂咖啡，做市場分析，甚至尋找和談判租賃。David 則是建立了一個特別用於研究的 AI 代理人，他給出了三個例子：你可以用它來寫一個基於最新新聞的播客節目稿；你也可以用它來獲取市場研究報告；此外還可以找到在 Hacker News 上流行的新 GitHub 倉庫。Anise 則是使用 Mobile Auto GPT 來部署你自己的 Auto GPT Telegram Bot，你也可以創建 Discord Bot，然後 AI 代理人就可以為你做所有的工作。Soul decoder 也提到了這個很酷的東西，我們在 Discord 中加入了 Auto GPT baby AGI，你可以向我們的 Bot 提問，它會創建 AI 代理人，自動完成我們的行銷和業務發展工作，我們可以查看輸出，並",
  "dialogue": "if you're into chat gbt you're probably, hearing about Auto GPT baby AGI and, agents this is essentially GPT on, steroids you see we're not hiring, interns or assistants anymore now we're, building them we're creating them and in, this video we're going to talk about all, the incredible ways that people are, using Auto gbt right now there's also, going to be a lot of Great Clips demos, to show exactly what they're doing so, make sure you stay until the very end, solely is using Auto GPT to build a, website in less than three minutes and, he mentions that the results are so, crazy that soon we won't even need a, code anymore he also gives more, information he mentions that the, objective was very simple create a, website using react and he does clarify, that this was just a basic example to, show what's possible it took him one, hour to set up a team of smart Engineers, could probably make an agent that's a, hundred times more complicated Andy, mentions took half a day to get it right, I tried initially to just prompt it to, build a website but it ends up getting, stuck in a loop Felipe is also doing, something really similar he's using Auto, gbt in this case baby AGI to write code, combining multiple files and then, shortly after he mentions that he made, some tweaks to make it a little bit, better baby AGI following a detailed, description of a small Python program, and correctly creating it by managing, multiple files with different classes in, this version it can write new code edit, existing code and run commands for, example to install dependencies and this, is pretty interesting he says that there, are 11 agents in this system One agent, allows human feedback before executing, each task but it's disabled in this, video this can possibly help to get, better results from the tasks or skip, unnecessary or duplicate tasks which he, says happens a lot Omar is using it for, sales prospecting and there's four, important screenshots in the first one, he gives it an objective he says we are, a SAS that helps you save time on hiring, interviews and in the following, screenshots you start seeing how it does, the research it compiles everything all, the emails the contacts with the final, result of drafting an email template for, outbound emails to Target companies, you're starting to see the trend Auto, gbt can do all your busy work such as a, to-do list that's how Garrett's using it, the thing that he built was that every, time you add a task a gpt4 agent is, spawned to complete it it already has, the context it needs on you and your, company and has access to your apps, that's also what Linus is using it for, he was playing around with god mode and, mentions that you can order your coffee, at Starbucks perform market analysis and, even find and negotiate a lease research, is something that auto GPT seems to be, pretty good at and that's also why David, launched an agent specifically designed, for research he gives three examples you, can use it to write a podcast script, based on the latest news you can also, use it to get a market research report, and also for new GitHub repos trending, on Hacker News when you give it and, objective the system will automatically, break it down and complete it here's, what it looks like if you want to write, a script for a podcast but as you can, imagine, you can write a ton of different content, whether it's for a website maybe you're, trying to write a book get some more, ideas that's what this can help you for, and on the academic side if you're a, teacher you can use Auto GPT to prepare, lesson plans here's another example of, an AI agent doing research for you and, in this case James is also using Auto, GPT to create an agent that researches, current affairs and then prepares a, podcast framework what about completing, goals that's what a seam is doing give, your own AI agent a goal and watch as it, thinks comes up with an execution plan, and takes actions and here's an, interesting one Anise is using mobile, auto GPT to deploy your own Auto GPT, telegram bot you can also create Discord, Bots and then the AI agents they can do, all the work for you Soul decoder, mentioned that this is insane we've, added Auto GPT baby AGI in Discord ask, our bot a question and it creates AI, agents that operate automatically on, their own and complete tasks for our, marketing and Business Development staff, can view output and collab on it very, easily he also adds some additional, thoughts if you thought Chachi PT was, crazy Auto GPT takes it to the next, level chains together llm's thoughts has, internet access long and short-term, memory access to websites and file, storage with Discord we can view and, even vote on the tasks it gives using, emojis John is using it to create, Virtual Worlds filled with AI agents, this is crazy I ran a 100 agent-wide, autonomous simulation of a virtual world, as part of a research project for, forever voices using nothing but Auto, GPT and gpt4 in the second video you'll, see that it decides on its own to bring, forward an economic crisis among our 100, AI personas as part of the virtual world, simulation it's kind of like you're, having a bunch of Sims but this time, they're a lot more advanced so who knows, what they're talking about thinking, about and planning to do next David is, using in Auto GPT to interact with the, blockchain today we signed one of the, first ever transactions on the, blockchain Via an autonomous AI agent, kryptonot GPT is able to understand how, to use crypto and send transactions and, interact with defy in this example the, agent swaps Matic for usdt and here's an, interesting one Joshua the CEO of do not, pay is using Auto gbt to manage his, finances he says that getting a refund, canceling a subscription fighting a, credit bureau and many other robot, lawyer products should be as simple as, texting your friend so he gave Auto GPT, access to his bank financial statements, credit report and email and according to, him he's up so far 217 dollars and 85, cents because Auto GPT is helping him, save money and he shows exactly how he, did it first using a do not pay plot, connection I had it log into every bank, account and credit card that I own and, Scan 10 000 Plus transactions it found, eighty dollars and eighty six cents, leaving my account every month in, useless subscriptions and offered to, cancel every single one the Bots got to, work mailing letters in the case of gyms, chatting automatically with agents and, even clicking online buttons to get them, canceled you see what's possible it can, chat with real agents and it can even, click around on a website he gives even, more details I asked it to scan the same, transactions and find me one where I, could get an easy refund from my email, it identified a United Airlines, in-flight Wi-Fi receipt for 36.99 from, London to New York and then asked me did, it work properly when I said no it, immediately drafted a persuasive and, firm legal letter to United requesting a, refund the letter was both legalistic, citing FTC statutes and convincing a bot, then sent it to them via their website, within 48 Hours United agreed to refund, the 36.99 he keep keeps going I wanted, to take a break from saving money and, ask gpt4 about my credit score using the, array API it got my score and Report, without advertisements or trying to sell, me a credit card I am currently working, on several gbt credit disputes and will, report back now it was time to unleash, gpt4 on my bills I'm a customer of, Comcast and so I asked it to negotiate, my bill when Comcast offered a 50, discount the bot pushed back it said no, I want more and it got 100 back GPT 3.5, never pushed back for what it's worth, and he ends it like this I am already up, 217.86 in under 24 hours and have a, dozen other disputes pending my goal is, to have gpt4 make me ten thousand, dollars which one's your favorite let me, know in the comments and if you're using, Auto GPT right now share your thoughts, the results your overall experiences, whatever you want that's it I'll see you, soon"
