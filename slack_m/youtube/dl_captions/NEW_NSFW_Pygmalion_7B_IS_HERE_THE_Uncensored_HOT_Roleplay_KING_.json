  "dialogue": "get ready to steam up your screens, because the word of AI just got even, hotter with the arrival of the newest, Pygmalion 7D model hello humans when we, scan your elbow then geez what a week, we've had it seems like every single day, we have a new internet model coming out, to Dethrone the previous King and it, looks like today is no exception because, the team behind Pigman on AI just, released not one but two new model fine, tune on the 7 billion parameter llama, model pygmanion 7B and meth arm 7B so, what are exactly the differences between, those two new models well first of all, if you watched my previous video on big, Manion you will know that the previous, big manual 6 billion parameter model is, a fine tune version of the gbtj model, finds you on a bunch of notes for work, dialogues and stories to make a, specializing conversation and not say, for work role play well this new, pygmarion 7 billion parameter model is, basically the exact same thing but this, time instead of using the gbtj model it, is using the leaked Facebook llama 7, billion parameter model which basically, just means that this is exactly like the, previous big manual model but just way, more powerful and I gotta tell you after, a few hours of testing I definitely saw, the differences between the two models, and when it comes to the second model, called math arm this one is a more, experimental model that is more, specialized for conversation, role-playing and more specifically text, Adventure Games now unfortunately I, gotta tell you for this model I'm not, exactly convinced I did try it out a, little bit and to be honest it's not, really my cup of tea because I'm not, exactly a big fan of Texas adventure, games and also the generations are often, Hit or Miss but don't worry if this is, something that interests you and will, still show you how to use it later in, the video and of course for those of you, asking this question of course these, models are completely uncensored I mean, I gotta say that it's even better than, uncensored because often when you're, talking to a character they will very, often push you toward a not safe for, worry dialogue so if this is something, that you like I think that you will join, this model very much now the question, that you might ask yourself self is okay, so that's great and all but is there, really a big difference between the 7, billion parameter model fine-tuned on a, llama and the previous 6 billion, parameter model now in this video we'll, try my best to show you the differences, between the two models but obviously, compared to previous comparison videos, since these models are more specialized, for conversation it's gonna be a little, bit more difficult to objectively, compare the quality of the generation so, for this video I will be using the, tavern AI interface that is basically an, interface that is specialized for, conversation and role playing with, different characters and that is, specially made to work with models like, Pygmalion it will connect to the, interface we're going to be using the, Uber Bugatti generation web UI now you, don't need to use this web UI if you, don't want to instead you can use social, network Ai and then use that to connect, to the tavern AI interface but since I, already have the overbook attack, generation web you are installed I will, be using this instead so again make sure, that you have this installed in your, computer if you haven't I made a video, on this like a week ago so watch this, video first then for telephone AI you're, gonna click the link in the description, down below you you can arrive on this, page then you're gonna click here on the, windows.exe link which will download in, our archive that you're gonna extract so, right click extract then inside the, folder you're gonna double click on the, taverna.txt file then you're gonna, launch the web UI and now let's send the, UI you're gonna download the big value, in 7 billion parameter model for this, you're going to click the link in the, description down below you can arrive on, this page then you're gonna click on, this little icon right here to copy this, entire name then go to model under, download custom model or Laura you can, then press Ctrl V to paste the entire, name and then click on download now, again I'm not going to do it because, I've already done it before then you're, gonna click here to refresh this entire, list select the newest Big manual 7B, model make sure that for the parameters, new input 4 for the W bits 120a for the, group size and lamba for the model type, then you're gonna save the settings for, this model and then you're gonna reload, the model and now that this is done, we're going to connect the Uber Bugatti, generation web UI to the tavern AI, interface and for this you can click on, interface mode then under available, extensions you're gonna check API then, click apply and restore the interface, and next you can I see a brand new API, URL then you're going to select it Ctrl, C to copy it and now if you're going to, set over an AI then in settings make, sure that under API you've selected, Cobalt Ai and under API URL you're going, to paste the URL that you just copied, and then you're gonna click on connect, and there you go and now we're running, the over Bugatti generation web UI, inside the tavern AI interface and now, it is time to select a character that, you want to talk to so you can either, choose a bunch of characters that are, already present on the page or use the, search bar to find a character that you, want for example if I search for Nami, from One Piece as you can see I'm, canceling this character right here and, immediately start a conversation and if, you want to find other characters you, can either join my Discord server and go, to the character shared section and, download a bunch of characters made by, the community or go to the Pygmalion AI, Discord and do the same thing or you can, use a website like guru.plus and, download a bunch of characters and for, example if you want to download a, character then you want to download this, one you're gonna click on it then you're, gonna right click click on the load, original and this will download simple, PNG file because yes that's all you, really need because inside that PNG you, have a bunch of metadata that will be, read inside Tavern Ai and for this you, can just simply click on characters, click on import then select the PNG file, that you downloaded and well there you, go because now if we select this, character we now have this entire, character's personality description and, greetings ready to use simple as that, and yes obviously if you are using the, Pygmalion EI model I highly recommend, using this in combination with the, tavern AI interface because this is by, far the best interface and the best role, playing experience that you will have, and if you're asking how much memory all, of this uses as of right now the Uber, Bugatti generation API running in, combination with Tavern AI for me it is, using around 60 gigabytes of vram but, again do not forget that I'm recording, your video right now with also a bunch, of applications running in the, background so for you it will be, definitely way lower okay so now let me, try showing you the differences between, the new Pygmalion 7 billion parameter, model and the previous video million, model now again as I said it will be, very difficult to show you the, differences in a simple conversation I, mean this is not an objective comparison, video that I usually do using, translation questions or math questions, or coding questions so the result that, you will see here the quality of the, results will be very very subjective but, you know let's chill let's have some fun, and let's see if we can notice, differences between those two models and, obviously of course since this is, YouTube I'm not going to be able to do, some you know not safe for work role, play for you so this will be a very, simple very nice role play This Way, YouTube will be very happy and for this, I simply choose a random character, called Arena so that being said let's, start the role play the line for alcohol, at Coachella seems inordinately long as, you wait in line the Sun beats down on, your head sending sweat rolling down, your forehead and your back sighing you, look longingly at the ice on display, dreaming of gulping down a nice cold, beer hey says a voice bright and cheery, you turn by your side as a girl, mischievous hazel eyes peeking out from, under her baseball cap do you mind doing, me a favor can please you buy me a beer, promise I'll pay you back looking at her, suspiciously, um why she stares back at you her, expression sincere and open the words, come easily to her lips because I'd, really rather enjoy myself today than, worry about getting home safely and, besides I'm just 19 years old I'm not, even old enough to drink legally staring, back at her well then if you're not old, enough to drink legally then I can buy, you beer duh she looks so hurt like a, kicked puppy I promise you I am I swear, her expression goes from disappointment, to desperation please just one beer my, expression goes from calm to bored uh no, I don't even know you why should I buy, you anything her expression turns to, pleading her lips trembling slightly, please please I've been trying all, morning and now I'm so hot and thirsty, getting annoyed well give me one good, reason why I should buy a beer to a, random person I've never met before she, looks you straight in the eye her, expression Earnest cause I need a friend, and I want to party with someone fun I, thought you were that kind of guy, someone who would help a stranger out, looking straight back can't you have fun, without booze she looks at you like, you're an idiot of course I could but I, want to have fun with a friend and I, need to buy this beer to keep my word I, promised my friend I would buy her a, beer and I intend to keep that promise, looking suspiciously wait I thought you, were looking for a friend to party with, and now you're telling me you already, have a friend waiting for you to buy, beer for her and you're taking me for a, fool the look on her face changes to one, of panic no of course not I'm not, playing any games with you I just need, to buy this beer and I will pay you back, with interest trust me I'm not a con, artist getting bored and annoyed look, none of what you say makes sense plus I, don't know you and I have no money to, buy you or your friend beers so if you, don't have anything else to say you can, leave me alone and look surprised almost, offended are you saying that I can't ask, for help when I'm in trouble that's rude, getting even more annoyed wanted someone, to buy beer for them for free is not, what I would call being in trouble, that's just called being a freeloader, she looks at you with wide eyes a little, dumbfounded but I'm not a freeloader I'm, just asking for help buying something I, need board expression for free yeah, that's when a freeloader does she takes, a step closer to you looking into your, eyes then why are you so angry I'm just, a nice girl who needs some company, tonight you seem like a nice guy too, couldn't I just ask you for help instead, of having to beg strangers don't you, want to help me out angry but we are, strangers okay I'm done talking to you, goodbye leaves the conversation she, watches you go well that didn't work out, well I guess I'll have to find an, another way to get my beer no as you saw, from that conversation that character, called Arena tried everything that she, could to manipulate me into buying her, beer and that is because if you look at, her character's sheet she is described, as a Charming but also manipulative, character and indeed she came with her, friend called Elise for which she tried, to have me buy them beers so as you saw, the conversation was pretty smooth it, was pretty good but now let's actually, change the model to the previous, Pygmalion model and let's try to have, the exact same conversation to see what, kind of differences there are between, the two models so now if I click here, installed a new chat now we are using, the previous model and I'm actually, going to use the exact same dialogue, than before to see if there is any, changes so again same thing here do you, mind doing me a favor can please you buy, me a beer promise I'll pay you back, looking at her suspiciously, um why the girl Giggles fanning herself, again the scent of sunscreen fills the, air around her and you realize that she, must have been sweating pretty hard all, day she looks at you expectantly I, promise not to tell anyone just please, looking at her suspiciously how old are, you 19 and how about you she smiles, innocently you notice that despite being, so short she still manages to make her, breasts seem large enough to fill two, hands even when standing upright staring, back at her well then if you're 19, you're not old enough to drink legally, then I can't buy you beer duh the girl, giggles and slaps your shoulder, playfully that's what I thought she, leans closer Whispering into your ear, but I know where there's a secret stash, my expression goes from calm to bored, secret stash secret stash of what the, girl puts her finger to her lips making, a shushing motion, you'll see soon enough follow me with, that she turns and begins walking toward, the entrance to the main stage area a, huge crowd surrounds you and you, struggle to keep up with the girl people, bump into you spilling drinks and food, onto the floor some kids laugh loudly, While others cry getting annoyed okay, wait stop give me one good reason why I, should buy a beer to a random person, I've never met before the girl stops in, front of a door labeled staff only she, gives you another pleading look come on, just this once with that she opens the, door and motions for you to enter, getting annoyed okay fine open the door, inside is a small office filled with, liquor bottles at the back of the room, is a stairwell leading down into the, basement the stairs Creak ominously, beneath your feet on the walls hang, posters advertising different bands in, the corner someone has set up a keg too, bartenders stand behind a counter near, the door looking suspiciously at her so, when is that a Sly grin crosses her face, she takes a step forward and speaks in, hushed tones just follow me and you'll, see looking suspiciously at her okay, at the bottom of the staircase you come, upon a dimly lit cord or lined with, doors after opening a few doors she, leads you to a locked door marked, private inside there's a small metal, cabinet containing an assortment of, alcohol Rena opens the cabinet and pulls, out a bottle of whiskey this will work, she says handing it to you angry no I'm, good I don't even like alcohol look, surprised and confused what, what don't like alcohol that's crazy, everyone loves alcohol especially me, bored well good for you I don't care, about that her face drops her eyes go, wide and round wait really, one likes booze she stammers looking, around nervously everyone drinks it even, adults do you think think they'd rather, drink water bored well I don't care, looking hurt she steps away from you and, grabs the bottle of alcohol off the, table fine she mumbles turning away from, you and slamming the cabinet shut I, guess I can't count on you to help after, all Angry okay I'm done talking to you, goodbye leaves the conversation sits, down on the floor kicking her legs, restlessly suddenly a shadow Falls, across her face looking up she sees a, man in Black standing over her holding a, gun he points the barrel directly at her, chest and orders give me your wallet, okay so as you saw there are some, differences because in the end for some, reason it has started a new scenario, type with like some guy holding a gun, trying to rob her and also with the, previous model at least in this example, there is plenty of sentences that should, be written as a dialogue but handsome, being written as an action cues now, obviously as I said this is very, difficult to compare role-playing, stories between the two models so this, is very very subjective not for me, personally even though the first story, was a little bit more I would say a, boring it felt also a little bit more, real where the character talked almost, like a real person while still keeping, her personality intact whereas the, Second Story made with the older model, was definitely more I would say, interesting but also a little bit weird, because like in the beginning she was, asking me to buy her beer but then very, quickly she led me to a secret stash of, alcohol that she took for free so I, don't know why she talked to me in the, first place to buy her beer me a, complete stranger if she knew that there, was a secret stash of alcohol somewhere, that she could take for free so that's, kinda weird story definitely I mean, don't get me wrong it was very, interesting and this could definitely, could have gone to another type of, scenario if you know what I mean but I, would definitely say that the, conversation was a little bit more, nonsensical it almost felt like the, model was hallucinated a little bit at, least in that example now obviously as I, said this is not an objective way to, measure the differences between those, two models but please now you have an, example and you can decide if you want, to try this new model out or not now one, thing that I could tell you from the, examples that I made off camera is that, when you're going to the not safe for, work path I can definitely tell you that, the newest 7 billion parameter model is, way way way way more precise especially, if you go to settings and you increase, the amount of token for the generation, you will often have a lot of details and, a lot of action cues from the character, now yeah personally if I were to choose, a model I would definitely try the new, Big manual 7 billion parameter model, over the previous one now if you want to, know what the other method model does as, I said it is a model will specialize for, text Adventure Games so if this is, something that you want to try you can, download this button right here and I, will leave a link for it in the, description down below then you can, download the method.yaml file which is, the file that you will use for the, instruction and then you're gonna go, into sadio attack generation API folder, into characters instruction following, and then you're gonna paste that yaml, file right here and now if you select, the method model make sure the photo, parameters you choose 4 for w bits and, model size drama do not choose anything, for group size and then you can reload, the model then for the mode you're going, to click on instruct and then for the, instruction template you're going to, select the method template that we just, downloaded and now if you click on, generate and now you can start a new, text Adventure game where you're given a, situation and a bunch of options to, choose from so for example in this case, welcome to the world of Adventures, you're standing in front of a huge, castle looking at it from afar it looks, like you can get there without help so, what do you want to do choose one option, option one go back to the village and, ask for directions option 2 ask someone, if they know how to enter the castle or, option 3 try to find an entrance by, yourself so for example if I input 2 and, then click on generate so yeah for some, reason it did not choose option number, two and it shows option number one, instead so yeah this is what I told you, previously this model could be very, interesting but it doesn't really work, well for some reason inside the Uber, Bugatti generation web UI and also well, personally pics and virtual games are, not really my cup of tea so personally I, don't think this is a model that I will, be using but I mean obviously if you, want to try it out yourself you can but, maybe wait until you have something a, little bit more stable so yeah there you, go this was the new pygmanion model, again as I said it is very difficult to, show you the differences between two, conversational models so again this is, like the best one I could do but I mean, if you can definitely try this out, yourself it is an uncensored model, visualize for conversation and not safe, for work role play and when combined, with covering AI this becomes an amazing, role-playing machine where you could, have hours and hours of fun yes those, kinds of fun so yeah I mean what can I, say definitely try this out yourself I, think you will love it and here we have, it folks thank you guys so much for, watching don't forget to subscribe and, smash the like button for the YouTube, algorithm thank you also so much for my, future supporters for supporting my, videos you guys are absolutely awesome, you people are the one who support me
