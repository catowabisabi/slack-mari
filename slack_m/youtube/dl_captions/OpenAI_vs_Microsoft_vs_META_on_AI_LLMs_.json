  "dialogue": "hello community, now let's have the biggest three, available large language model available, for free and I have a particular task, let's compete now, so here we go I have a simple task I, want the complete ideation process for, my new home page done by EI now you know, there are a lot of other Alternatives, you can draw mind maps you can discuss, with your colleagues or whatever or if, you want to process solution ideation is, the process where you generate ideas and, solution through sessions such as, sketching prototyping brainstorming, brain writing the worst possible ideas, and a wealth of other ideation, techniques and of course if you know, ideal and you have been trained by Audio, like I have so ideation is also the, third stage and the design thinking, process, and now I would like to see how much is, AI valuable for me, so here we have I have one identical, task and I take the three biggest free, conversational AI system and you notice, chat GPT I mean the free version the 3.5, from openai the Bing chat I'm supposed, to be a gbt4 but with promoters and, deterring models I don't really know, what system I'm gonna get with Bing chat, from Microsoft, and then relatively new is hugging face, chat or hugging chat, which is based on a 30 billion free, trainable parameter llama model and you, know there's some problem with the, commercial license here but these are my, three systems I want to try out today, and the intelligence you might ask, where's the intelligence this is my ICL, prompt I will use here on all three, machines for a continuous learning and, an iterative optimization of my optimize, of my ideation process, so this is one prompt that I will input, in all three machines and this prompt is, you know me ICL, so I see read all the instruction and, respond got it so at first I tell him, you're an advanced and intelligent idea, Creator PhD in um psychology you know, how to use emotional trigger and you, help me to create and design the most, informative concise an attractive text, segments for my new homepage, and we have a process that we go through, a b and c, a is easy whatever is my input he will, or chat tpd or the system, will optimize the text and it comes back, with an optimized a text based on new, insights and ideas, then B I want that the system provides, me with three additional suggestions, based on a on what further details I, could include to optimize the text, and see if there are any open question, left in the context of a and b, or have I forgotten something so what, additional information is needed in the, Judgment of our conversational AI system, this is a process I go through a b c a b, c a b c and whenever I feel that now the, ideation process and the text that is, created by the system is perfect I say, end and I say now comes the second part, I will submit you this up to my text and, you become my designer for my perfect, new homepage to generate the main, elements of my new homepage the title, The Hero the main header text attacks, for the paragraph the overall design so, design is now the Second Step the layout, of my home page, and we will continue this iterative, process with you the AI system, interrogating me and you present helpful, insights and update the text and the, optimize text section until we end this, is one prompt, that, enables the machine to have a continuous, conversation with me and I can, continuously update, so, this takes care about here that you do, not have start new order you do not have, to have a vector database externally, outside of AI where you have to keep, track no with this little specific ICL, prompt the system remembers and the, system optimizes itself and you have not, to store any external data outside of, the AI system, and I think you will see this now or you, want to see this in action so let's have, here a comparison of the biggest tree, conversational AI systems that are of, course large language mods, so here we are now if I want to create, the content of my home page let's see, how chat GPT can help me now at first, for the prompt I have here a specific, prompt design, I assure you it is rather easy, I say hey read all of the instruction I, want you to be an advanced and, intelligent idea Creator you have a PhD, in human psychology you know how to use, emotional triggers you helped me to, create and design the most informative, concise and attractive text segments for, my new home page, we have a process you ask me, you optimize the text you provide new, ideas and you have open question and, reiterate over this if you want to have, a look at it read it use it, so here we go input our main focus so, what how do I start, I start with what I have, so I have a YouTube channel for new, videos on how to code Ai and specific, use cases so attractivity welcome to my, YouTube channel dedicated to teaching, you how to code AI systems with over 400, videos covering various use cases in, different application sectors you will, be able to find a perfect tutorial for, your needs whether you are beginner, Advanced programmer our videos will be, clear and create Cutting Edge Dimension, yes beautiful so you see he gives me a, first, impression of here my first idea and he, already formulates it, insightful community of like-minded, individuals and discover the endless, possibilities of AI technology nice, already something positive so now, new ideas that chatubity shows me, include a section of frequently asked, questions to help clarify doubts support, for your audience okay consider, featuring case studies to Showcase a, real world application of AI systems you, teach giving your audience practical, examples to follow yes however, utilize interactive tools quizzes or, challenges, okay I like this can you provide me in, different sectors okay, Advanced programmers feedback can help, us improve the content, so I say hmm, okay you see, integrate new ideas we'd like to provide, content for beginners Advanced, professional how to like it in everyday, life insights how the models work what, are the risk associated with it what AI, system or llm models to choose for your, specific task and provide a platform for, my subscribers to exchange their, experiences with different models and, their recommendations, so now chat GPT integrates all of this, in now and extend it, um idea generation very nice so I have, to read it in a second, as you can see he's having some open, question yeah so new ideas incorporate, case studies from everyday life okay, yeah develop a knowledge page section, with resources links and recommended, readings, wow this is almost like uh like a, teaching about it consider hosting, webinars and workshop with industrial, experts, well I don't know about that what else, open question most common challenges in, question beginners face okay can you, provide specific examples how do your, fasting and ensure a sense of community, okay so where we are, okay what else what else to input, so I provide him now with the, information I would like to have Vision, Transformers and LMS on everything and, chat chipity comes up here with a new, and I said also a paid subscription, service for some short professional, advice, solvable in minutes this is now also, integrated in the next optimized text, you can see our optimized text ideation, becomes longer and longer but it comes, up with new ideas look at B new ideas, a really interesting open question this, is nice but let's say we end here and we, come now to part two of my prompt so you, see chat Chipotle says great I will now, proceed the second step and become a, designer for your perfect new home page, provide me please with the details so I, tell him integrate the text that we, created now together put in your home, page I want to have focus on visual, elements, reduce long text passages and draft here, my first elements and now chat GPT, starts here to create my homepage text, for me because for example welcome to, the my AI education platform I'm here to, help you learn to code and use, artificial intelligence system in, everyday life with over 400 videos on my, YouTube channel and you see it goes on, and on and on, and then he comes now and says here, as the design elements for your homepage, will need to work on that together, here's a list of essential elements we, need to include the hero image, navigation menu call to action button, testimonials user-friendly Forum, responsive and mobile friendly design, foreign, and as you can see set the turn of the, response precise what you like to talk, about and now I integrate here again, so you see the text is a little bit too, much for Bing it's not all in so let's, see if it understands yeah input our, main focus, so here we go again, I have 400 videos about how to code AI, in a YouTube channel and I would like to, promote my YouTube channel with an, additional hope page, so it comes now with optimize learn AI, coding with our tutorials easy to follow, tutorials will guide you through the, basic and Advanced Techniques new ideas, most popular videos, testimonials classical provide a call to, action okay, what is the target audience this is a, good question what are some of the most, popular topics special offers promotion, this is very marketing, hmm okay so one that I will take is, um the target audience the target, audience, so my target audience is from beginners, to Advanced my target, should extend to people interested in, your eyes so they can understand how l m, models work what are the risks, associated with it and what benefits can, llm have if you interface it in the good, and in the correct way to get out the, most out of it, so, it's it is not as chatty it is not as, attractive, add a section that highlight the risk at, a section, provide a clear call again, open questions are the same what are, some of the most popular topics do you, have special others of us were there any, specific alarms, it is not that, helpful for me to Advance here, so I say I will include some use cases, of AI in different academic and, Industrial sectors from astrophysics to, genetics from education to create simple, home pages, comes up with YouTube channel office, wide range of use cases, section section clear call of action, any special offers any special just, repeat itself it's just the repeat, itself there's no new idea no so I stop, here sorry Microsoft Edge Bing chat I'm, so sorry but no this, is not what I was looking for okay, here we go hugging chat, beautiful so here we are let's make it a, little bit bigger beautiful so ask, anything here we go, I just put here the third time the same, prompt template, in and I'm just waiting that he comes, back and says okay let's start, wow this takes longer, yeah I should mention this is only a 30, billion parameter model and a llama, model, so it is definitely smaller just please, keep this in mind, stop generating we're still waiting, so I think there's a little bit more, leeway, trying to understand my specific prompt, template now, we are still waiting, and we are still waiting, thanks, okay, so what else is now the result for my, task to create the optimal ideation, process, supported by a conversational AI the, biggest three model available at no cost, today, yeah hugging chat in the free version, that I used based on a llama30b model, gets this third place, because hugging face simply sometimes, stop responding when confronted with a, more complex task and I have to say my, task is not an easy one, okay it competes with model that are at, least 5 to 20 times bigger and this just, in one dimension like in the size of the, freely trainable parameters and I'm not, talking about additional reinforcement, learning by human feedback so first, insight, 30 billion parameters model like Lama, 30b in particular here are currently not, up to the task for some intelligence, continuous feedback, and, second place goes to Bing chat pink chat, as you know, and as noted by vice president of, Microsoft said it's not always gpt4, because GPT 4 is too expensive for, Microsoft to run, so they are running now on their, Microsoft server, with the intelligent switching by, promita is here the Microsoft touring, models which are much cheaper for, Microsoft to run, and also pink chat has in those days and, it's now been upgraded for image, processing and third-party apps and open, the pure intelligent that Bing chat can, provide even after this update, is very limited it has unbelievable, fancy features, but given my complex task it is simply, missing the intelligence, and so we come to the winner, good old chat GPT no not the paid plus, version for 20 bucks a month but a free, old GPD Suite tourable, is clearly the winner, in here my contest, powerful performance continuous ideation, completely interactive creating, brainstorming process with an, unbelievable good and free large, language model, so if you want to start here iterative, processing, for your ideation 4 a new web page four, new tasks four new goals that you have, in your life whatever you want to have, here a continuous optimization in the, communication process, chat GPT from the free available biggest, llm is definitely doing, I hope to see you in one of my other, videos"
