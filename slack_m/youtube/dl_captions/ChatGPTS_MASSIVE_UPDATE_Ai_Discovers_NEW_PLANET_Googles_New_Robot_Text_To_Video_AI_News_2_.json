  "dialogue": "from Boston Dynamics to chat tbt's major, upgrades this has been a massive week in, AI so let's cover absolutely everything, you missed and without further Ado let's, get started so we had a Gen 2 released, the amazing text video where essentially, you need zero Driving Image you can just, type in a Searcher catching a wave and, just like that we now have footage this, is really good because now we don't need, any input image and we can literally, just use a simple text prompt to gain an, entire video output now this Gen 2 is, not the only insane thing that there is, because boy oh boy trust me when I tell, you there have been some other stuff, that people have done with this software, and trust me you're going to enjoy this, so this user by the name of pizza later, decided to create a fully made AI, commercial that is about a pizza spot, and you can see right here he used text, to video to create the visuals for this, and then decided to edit it all together, with some nice voiceover I'm going to, leave a link to his Twitter account, because he honestly creates some amazing, stuff and it's very very uncanny at how, realistic this somewhat is and these, even sound better with sound take a look, at this one created by Amar Rishi it, sounds amazing boldly calculating the, cost of Victory this is a tale of, courageable human Spirit Rising against, the tide of evil this is the story of a, world at war prepare for a journey into, the Heart of Darkness this is World War, II, so yeah Gen 2 releasing their text to, video model honestly has so many, applications there have literally been, so many videos that are circulating, online of people creating masterpieces, like the one you just saw so what, happens when they release a gen 3., honestly AI is so exciting then we had, this amazing research paper and honestly, at first glance it doesn't seem like, much but understand what you're looking, at right here it's truly amazing it says, scaling Transformer to 1 million tokens, and Beyond with rmt now why is this, actually insane so rmt stands for, recurrent memory Transformer and gpt4, actually has 8 000 tokens in its normal, way and of course they also newly, released the 32 000 token contact length, which they are separately rolling out, now this paper Acts actually allows 1, million tokens they figured out a way to, get one million tokens so essentially, what this means is that gpt4 or, potentially large language models in the, future are going to be able to remember, one million worth of tokens which, essentially means that they can now, write novels they can write entire, screenplays they can write entire movies, entire trilogies if you will just based, on the fact that they're able to retain, information you have to understand that, this was one of the huge limitations of, large language models because a lot of, the time when you're having a, conversation eventually it forgets what, was said and of course you can't have, something effective if it can't write, for very long periods of time so this is, something that is going to be truly game, changing but when it's finally deployed, it's going to be absolutely insane now, everybody knows what Boston Dynamics, robots are I'm pretty sure you've seen, them freaking out everyone but recently, a machine learning engineer by the name, of Santiago decided to integrate his own, Boston Dynamic spot robot with chat GP T, now it's actually pretty insane because, they use this to essentially power the, robot so that they can ask it questions, and that they can you know dictate to it, to say something and then it gives it a, pretty decent response honestly find the, entire interaction pretty pretty cool, and you can check out all of the links, in the description that you can see the, entirety of the clips because honestly, today there's just too much to get, through so this company called Forefront, decided to release an upgraded version, of chat GPT where essentially it's chat, GPT powered by gpt4 it has unlimited, uses and you can have many different, interactions with this large language, model because essentially what they're, doing is they're allowing you to, essentially fine tune it to any means, necessary you can see right here that, the user is essentially just talking, with it on many different tasks and you, can also get images from it there are, many different ways to talk about these, images and of course you could also, essentially have many different, characters that are embedded into the, software so it's a way that people are, accessing gpt4 at the current moment for, free and it's currently in Alpha so this, is something that is very interesting, because a lot of people are fine-tuning, ways to change the experience of chat, GPT now many people know about Auto GPT, where essentially you put one prompt in, and then the AI goes off and does, completely what it wants to do but this, week was pretty insane because we had, many different users that were able to, use their own Auto gpts and essentially, fine-tune them to get them to do things, for example one example right here was, we had a user who got it to essentially, code a specific website and code it with, very quick accuracy now remember this is, what people usually do with gpd4 you, have to ask it many different things and, then it gives you the final code but, with this you ask it one question and, then it runs off and does everything by, itself we also had some other I guess, you could say applications that are, being developed and are likely to be, deployed with a lot of internet access, later this year with the likes of agent, GPT being released it just goes to show, exactly what these kind of autonomous, agents are capable of and exactly how, they think and how they decided to, develop their plans and strategies this, example was where someone decried to, create hustle GPT which is essentially a, bot that is trying to make as much money, as possible and I actually did use this, and I did have a lot of fun with one, that was also released which is called, gold GPT which is completely free you, can also use this I was giving it tasks, to essentially create a, multi-millionaire from scratch because I, wanted to see what its thought making, process was and it was very interesting, to see how AI with a very very high IQ, formulates its ideas and thinking, process in order to achieve its end goal, and it was just interesting to see that, inner workings rather than just seeing a, final prompt so definitely something, that I recommend you do play around with, now this was truly absolutely incredible, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw, that adobe released a firefly update for, video this was the first of its kind, there is honestly too much to dive into, this I'll leave a link to the full video, in the description but essentially what, Adobe has done is they've literally, changed the game with video editing by, adding a bunch of AI tools embedded into, the video software where you can use, natural language to change the color, scheme of the video you can use natural, language to generate music you can use, it to generate captions instantly you, can literally use it to generate, storeboards guys it is absolutely insane, to be a content creator or someone, working within media because the types, of content that we are going to be, getting in the future are likely to be, very automated and also very quick in, terms of the production process because, essentially what adobe's AI is now able, to do is it's able to identify the, boring parts of the workload and then, essentially just automate those in order, to speed up the video creation process, like right here you can see that they're, able to generate storyboards just based, off a script and you're able to, visualize those storyboards using them, for whatever short film you're going to, be making so it's likely to just, increase the efficiency and production, capabilities of people who otherwise, wouldn't have these tools available to, them directly we also had interestingly, enough Microsoft announced that they're, working on a new chip called Athena now, the reason that they chose to work on, this chip is because essentially nvidias, are very very expensive and they're, deciding that they need to do this to, offset the cost because Nvidia gpus, currently cost around 40 000 each and of, course Google is also trying to work on, their chips which they are claiming that, outperforms some of Nvidia so we can see, that even on the hardware side the AR, race is truly heating up even if it's in, the background now this is where I've, got probably the biggest news in the, video now everyone uses chat gbt but, recently chat gbt in Alpha rolling out, to a limited number of users was given, internet access so you can see right, here that it says default GPT 3.5 with, browsing optimized for Speed and can, browse the internet now I haven't seen, any actual use cases for this and I, haven't actually seen openai release any, statements about internet access but it, does actually seem pretty legit based on, the screenshots I've seen floating, around on the internet and based on the, kind of plugins that we've seen, integrated with chat GPT before and we, do know that internet access was a, previous limitation based on the data, only being available from 2021 so this, is a screenshot of what it does look, like I'll leave a link to the thread on, Twitter where someone explains exactly, their experience of how they're, currently using gpt3 and gbt4 with the, internet so if you don't actually have, access yet well I guess it's just slowly, being rolled out in Alpha to a select, number of users and I'm guessing they're, going to get that feedback and then, potentially refine the software so, honestly if GPT 4 does really get access, to the internet I think things are about, to change really really quickly so, that's probably going to be the most, interesting thing that I'm looking, forward to then we had something really, cool so everybody knows what stable, diffusion is and then we got the largest, and best model yet in stable the fusion, we got stable diffusion XL now what's, great about this is not just its image, Jam generation capabilities the best, thing that we are getting now with AI we, are now getting the ability to of course, have better prompts but text is, something that is now actually working, so legible text was one of the largest, barriers to AI image generation that we, didn't have before and now that is, something that is a reality so like I, said many different things are happening, in the space and it is moving very very, quickly so I would recommend checking, out stable Fusion because the new, feature is definitely really awesome, although it does take a few prompts it, still is a large step in the right, direction then we've got one of the, scariest pieces of Technology I've seen, recently now everybody's been scared, about AI voice cloning and people, managing to clone your voice but this, one just knocks out of the park because, their speech into this is just far too, human-like like it's insane just take a, look at these audio samples, I used to work at a fire hydrant, Factory and you know you couldn't park, anywhere near the place, it's for radio and I, in the print, now remember what you heard just there, was completely 100 artificial, intelligence now I do know that the, clarity of that voice wasn't the best, like 11 Labs but it's what the, inflections are doing that we need to, pay attention to it's the ums it's the, URS it's the little tones in your voice, that make it sound a lot more realistic, which means that it's going to fool, people even which does mean that it's, going to be increasingly harder to, detect these AI voices now something, that I do want to add although this, technology is quite impressive you have, to remember that like I've said many, times before Google has been advanced in, many different AI Fields but they just, for some reason won't release their, technology compare Bach to what Google, released in 2018, [Music], um I'm looking for something on May 3rd, to work give me one second, so yeah five years ago Google was, sitting on a piece of technology that, had AI voices that sound exactly like, humans that could literally make phone, calls and book appointments so what are, they doing with the technology we don't, know at the moment so there's still some, more developments that we do need to get, to the coolest ones was video GPT and, video GPT is essentially what it says, you know you can literally talk with, videos in a chat session and what's, really good about this is that this kind, of Technology can be used to identify, many different things now it's not just, something that can be used to identify, basic stuff essentially what you can, actually do with it is you can query it, so you can ask it you know where is it, what are they doing how does that work, so essentially you can get information, out of the video and you can get some, kind of understanding rather than just, saying okay the trees are green the, floor is you know black or whatever so, it it literally tells you what people, are wearing it tells you what they're, doing it tells you why they're doing it, and it's something that is free at the, moment so this is something that you can, actually use and it's actually pretty, pretty accurate because I tested this in, a video which I will leave a link to in, the description and it was something, that I didn't think got enough attention, so it's definitely something that you, should check out but it just goes to, show what could actually happen when, openai finally released their gpt4 with, images and then of course finally in the, future perhaps releasing that one with, videos because of course as we know, images make up videos Google came with, another announcement talking about their, new browser called project Magi which is, essentially a browser that is focused on, AI answers and having the AI integrated, into the browser so it's definitely, going to be something that competes with, Bing because of course as you know Bard, wasn't technically what we all expected, and what we all wanted so I'm guessing, that Google is trying to shift their, focus onto what they already have the, competitive advantage on and then of, course integrating an AI with that to, provide a much better service than Bing, does so it'll be interesting to see when, this releases this month because that's, when it's scheduled for and let me know, if this is going to be something that, you're going to be testing out the then, we had a University of Georgia research, team confirming the evidence of a, previously unknown planet outside the, solar system and essentially what they, did they were able to use Machining, learning tools to detect it now the, reason this is actually really cool news, is because they already previously, scanned that specific area and they, didn't find anything but the Machining, learning tool that they used actually, was able to detect this planet outside, the solar system which meant that these, tools that we're using can previously, find things that we may have missed then, of course we had Google's Deep Mind the, new project which was essentially to, teach some robots from scratch how to, play football and they were actually, pretty effective at this they're able to, get up pretty quickly they're able to, score goals they're able to perform, defensive tactics and this was all done, using deep reinforcement learning which, is where you know you train a robot or, you train an AI on a specific number of, times usually millions of times and then, eventually after those times it becomes, really good at performing a specific, task or I guess you could say in this, task which was to play football so it, was definitely really interesting see, how these small robots are able to get, up quickly perform strategic defensive, behaviors that are very very interesting, to see and honestly I think this is, going to be more interesting in the, future when we have much more capable, robots performing much different tasks"
