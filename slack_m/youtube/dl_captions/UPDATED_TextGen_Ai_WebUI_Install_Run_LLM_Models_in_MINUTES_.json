  "dialogue": "a little more than a week ago I made a, video showing you how to install the, Uber bug attack generation web UI but, unfortunately just a few days later they, changed the installation process making, my previous video completely obsolete, great thanks so I simply decided to make, an updated video just for you let's hope, this video stays relevant a bit longer, this time hello humans when we scan your, overload and in this video I'm going to, very quickly show you how to install the, Uber bugattack generation web UI go over, the most common errors and how to solve, them and at the end I will show you how, to use the web UI even if you don't have, a powerful computer and all of that for, absolutely free now I'm gonna mix in, some clips from the previous video I did, another subject so if you haven't, watched it yet I will show you the same, thing in this video so let's not waste, any more time and let's go now my, previous video is not exactly completely, obsolete because if you want to use the, old installation guide instead of using, uberugate generation web UI GitHub page, you will be using this one click, installers instead so basically if you, want to follow the previous installation, you're going to Simply click the link in, the description down below you can, arrive on this page and here you're, going to click on code and then download, the zip and then follow the exact same, installation that I showed you in my, previous video and now let's actually do, the updating installation so once you, arrive for the Uber who got Asian ratio, with UI page you're gonna scroll down, until you see the one Cricut installers, and then you're gonna click on the uber, booger Windows the zip link and this, will download the zip archive onto your, computer so then once you have receive, archive you're gonna extract it so, you're gonna right click and then click, on extract then in the Uber Windows, folder you're gonna see a bunch of files, and just in case you don't know what, you're doing you have here an, instructions the text file that, basically tells you exactly what you, need to know to correctly install the, web UI but all you need to do now to, store the installation is just double, click on the start windows.bat file and, if you get this following error that, says this script relies on miniconda, which cannot be suddenly installed under, a path with spaces all that means is, that you need to pay attention to the, folder path name because for example in, my case look at what you see here I have, a new folder called new Uber which has a, space in the name and this is a no-go so, if you want to install the Uber buga, correctly you need to rename that folder, to make sure that there is no space in, the name so very simply all you have to, do is just go back to the folder in here, instead of having a folder called new, Uber I'm going to easily that space and, then replace it with an underscore so, I'm gonna have something like a new, underscore Uber and then press enter and, now if I go again inside the folder and, then double click on the soft, windows.but file again now it's going to, start installing all the files it needs, to run the web UI now for this you need, to be patient because it's going to take, some time and then it's going to ask you, what is your GPU so here you're going to, select what is your GPU if you have a, Nvidia GPU and AMD an apple M series or, if you want to run this in CPU mode, which by the way I don't necessarily, recommend because it often creates a lot, of issues but if you don't have a good, GPU and you really want to run it, locally you can of course select this, option but in my case since I have an, Nvidia 3090 I'm going to select a and, then press enter and then it's going to, start downloading all the files it needs, to run now be patient because it's gonna, take some time and there you go after a, few minutes it has finished downloading, all the files that it needs and for me, it took around 10 minutes so it might be, shorter or longer for you depending on, your internet connection and then it's, gonna ask you what model you want to, download because yes the web UI is just, a web UI to run an nlm model but for, this you need an nlm model to run now, you can either select one of the models, that they give you right here which are, not that bad or you can manually specify, a hugging face model this is the option, that you're gonna use to download a, model and currently there are three, models that I suggest you to download, the first one and probably the most, powerful one is the vicunia 13 billion, parameters 1.5 model 4-bit version which, is a super powerful local nnam model, that is probably one of the most, powerful NM model that you can run, locally right now I also made a video, about this model a few weeks ago so if, you haven't watched it definitely check, it out but the problem is although this, model is very powerful it is, unfortunately a censored model which is, where the gpt4 alpaca comes into play, which is also a super powerful Nana, model but this time it is completely, uncensored and again if you want to, check it out if you want to see what, kind of things you can do with this, model I highly suggest that you watch my, previous video on the subject and if you, are interested in a model that is, specialized for conversation and spicy, role play in that case I highly suggest, the big money on LM model which is, actually the model that I use the most, often because of how good it is when it, comes to conversation and of course I, also made a video about that model so, again if you haven't watched it I highly, recommend that you do and for this, example I'm actually gonna download the, pig manual model right now and to do, this is very simple you're gonna come, here on this page click on this little, icon right here to copy this entire name, and then back in the command prompt, window you're gonna type L which, corresponds to manually specify a, hugging face model then press enter and, then you're gonna press Ctrl V to paste, the full name that we just copied and, then you're gonna press enter and as you, can see info install automatically logic, all the files that it needs to run the, model and there we go after a few, minutes the model is downloaded and the, web UI is ready to be used it's going to, give you a local URL that if you want to, open you can just hold Ctrl and then, left click and there we go now we are, done now again you will see here A bunch, of options you have the text generation, tab we could have a conversation with, your Bot you have the character tab, where you can create or upload already, made characters with different names and, personalities you have the parameters, tab where you have here A bunch of, presets that you can use to change the, generation parameters and here I hear an, explanation for each parameters and what, they do and how it influence the final, results then you have the model tab, where you'll be able to select your, model if you have multiple models, installed or even a text Laura that you, downloaded or create it yourself then, you have the training tab where you can, train Allura from your own data and, finally the interface mode where you can, download and activate a bunch of, extensions and also a bunch of flags, anywhere you can change the interface of, the web UI to something completely, different all so each time that you, download the model they will be located, in the models folder which is located in, text generational API and then models, and as you can see this is where all of, your models will be located so if you, want to change anything or delete a, model that you don't use you're gonna, have to come into this folder right here, also next time that you want to update, the web UI all you have to do is just, double click on the update windows.bat, file and this will make sure that you're, running the latest version of the web UI, now one common error that you might see, when using the web UI is the Cuda out of, memory error and all that means is that, your GPU doesn't have enough vram to run, the operation but fortunately there is a, quick fix and the Quick Fix is to use, the pre-layer argument which is, basically an option that allows you to, explain the model between the vram and, the ram so pre-layer is the number of, layers that the model will load into the, memory so the more layers you have in, vram the faster your GPU will be able to, run the model but that also means that, the more layers you have the more evram, it's gonna use now mostly in the models, of around 40 layers in total with each, layer requiring around 0.232 megabytes, of memory which means that if you have a, 6 gigabyte vram GPU you can only input, 25 layers which should work but will be, very very slow and to be able to use, that argument all you need is just run, the web UI then go to models and here, you will see the pre-lay there option, where you can input a number right here, now obviously this number will depend on, the amount of vram that you have and, also depending on the system this number, can also greatly vary but in general if, you have a 6 Gigabytes vram card you, would put a pre-layer number between 20, and 25 if you have an 8 gigabytes of, vram card you would probably put it, between 27 and 30 if you have a 10, gigabytes card you're probably going to, input a number around 35 and more if you, have a 12 gigabytes vram and then once, you're done do not forget to reload the, model and maybe also save the settings, so that each time that you load this, model every parameters will be applied, automatically me now one thing that you, can also do but that is only when you're, not running a 4-bit version of a model, is to run a model in 8-bit which will of, course make the generation slower but we, also greatly decrease the amount of vram, used now obviously if you're running a, 4-bit version of a model this ocean is, of course useless so only check this, option when you're running a full, version of a model and not a quantized, version now also make sure that the max, new tokens is not too high because the, higher the number the more vram it's, gonna use so definitely play around a, little bit with the parameter depending, on your system okay so most common error, number two CPU allocator error so this, basically just means that you don't have, enough virtual memory to run the, operation now the virtual memory is, basically a way for your computer to, pretend that it has more memory than it, actually has which allows you to run, programs that require more memory than, your physical memory can provide and, solving this issue is actually very very, simple all you need to do is just go to, your startup menu then tie type system, properties advanced.exe I will leave, this command in the description down, below then you're going to click on it, then in advanced under performance, you're going to click on settings in the, performance options you can again click, on Advanced under virtual memory you're, gonna click on change then you're gonna, uncheck automatically manage paging file, size for all drives and then leave it, for system manage size and then click OK, and then it's going to ask you to, restart your computer and there you go, so just by increasing your virtual, memory not only you could potentially, increase the performance of your, computer but this should also solve the, CPU allocator error so that's pretty, cool and now hopefully all of these, little tricks will allow you to run the, web UI without issue but again if for, some reason you still get errors and, again highly suggest you to search for, your issue on the GitHub page for the, Uber Bugatti generation web UI this, should always be the go-to for you to, quickly solve your issues okay so now, let's say that no matter what you do you, just cannot run this on your computer, it's either not powerful enough or you, get too many errors or you just don't, have a computer at all is there a way to, run this web UI for free even if I don't, have a computer well yes there is, because for this we'll be using a simple, Google collab doc which will allow you, to run the web UI Online and download, any model that you want exactly as if, this was running on your local computer, and I'm actually gonna say that if you, don't have a 12 gigabyte GPU this should, in theory be way faster for you so I, highly recommend you that you train out, and use it in this super simple first, you're gonna scroll down and you're, gonna click on the first run cell button, and when they ask you if you want to run, this notebook you're going to click on, run anyway so then it's gonna give you a, music player and you're gonna press on, the play button which will play a silent, sound that will allow you to keep this, tab open so that the Google column block, does not boot you out so then you're, gonna scroll down and here if you want, to save the conversation for later you, can check this box that says save logs, to Google Drive which will as its name, implies will save the logs onto your own, person on Google Drive so that you can, continue the conversation where you're, left off now in this example I'm not, going to use it so I'm just going to, uncheck it you can also check this, button to save everything to Google, Drive which will make it way faster for, you to load the web UI next time because, all the models will be already, downloaded and present on your Google, Drive Then You're Gonna Leave This by, default and then click on the second run, cell button so then after a few minutes, once it has downloaded all the files, that it needs just when you try to, install it on your local computer it's, gonna ask you to download a model and, here you have either the choice of, downloading the vocunia model the gpt4, alpaca model or the Facebook opt model, but just like I showed you earlier in, the video you can download any model, that you want because for example let's, say that I want to download the big, money on AI model all you need is just, come here click on this little button to, copy this entire name then for the model, download you're going to select this, entire line and then you're gonna press, Ctrl V to paste this entire name and, then all you need to do is just click on, the Run cell button and as you can see, in this case it will start automatically, downloads the bigvanian model and there, we go very quickly it has downloading, the Big Value model and then it's gonna, ask you which model that you want to, load and for this all you need to do, just select here the full name of the, folder Ctrl C to copy it then you're, going to select this line and then Ctrl, V to replace it then for this model, you're going to leave everything else by, default and then click on this run cell, button and there you go now everything, is done and now if I click on this, purple URL you see that we are now, running the Uber Bugatti generation wave, UI using a very simple Google color Doc, and now you can have conversation with, any character that you want for, absolutely free and if you want to know, what kind of conversations you can have, well I highly suggest that you watch my, previous video on the subject because, yes now there is absolutely no limit, nothing is stopping you from having, spicy conversations so yeah there you go, no I think that no matter who you are, you should be able to use the Uber, Bugatti generation web UI either on your, local computer or on any devices for, absolutely free so definitely try this, out and everyone folks thank you guys so, much watching don't forget to subscribe, and smash the like button for the, YouTube algorithm take it also so much, to my patreon supporters for supporting, my videos you guys are absolutely, awesome you people are the
