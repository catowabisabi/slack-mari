  "summary": "詳細信息摘要：在此視頻中，演講者介紹了將人工智能（AI）與Web開發相結合的新技術。他們展示了一個執行車道鏈任務的任務，以發送由GPT3撰寫的電子郵件，並通過新的車道鏈國家啤酒整合發送。此集成允許聊天機器人對Zapier連接的應用程序執行操作。然後，揚聲器解釋了代碼，並提供了帶有代碼的GitHub回購。該代碼是10行代碼，並使用OpenAI的GPT完成，車道鏈代理和Zapier的新自然語言API。揚聲器還提供了指向木星庫的鏈接和有關如何設置代碼的說明。最後，他們解釋了代碼的工作原理以及如何設置代碼。\n\n子彈點摘要：\n - 引入一項結合人工智能（AI）和網絡開發的新技術\n - 演示一項通道鏈任務，以發送由GPT3撰寫的電子郵件\n - 集成車道連鎖狀態啤酒以允許聊天機器人在應用程序上執行操作\n - 使用OpenAI的GPT完成，車道鏈代理和Zapier的新自然語言API，在帶有10行代碼的GitHub存儲庫中提供的代碼\n - 鏈接到木星庫以及有關如何設置代碼的說明\n - 說明代碼的工作原理以及如何設置代碼。",
  "dialogue": "hey guys welcome to Stormer before we, talk about artificial intelligence and, web development today I have a really, cool demo to show you that we're going, to send a Gmail an email that's written, by gpt3 and sent through this new Lane, chain State beer integration that just, came out two days ago and this is, actually mind-blowing I couldn't believe, that it actually sent the email and, wrote it all out for me because now we, can use these chat Bots to perform, actions on all the apps that zapier, connects with so this is extremely, powerful let's jump right into it and, I'm going to show you what we can do and, then we're going to discuss all the code, and how it works and I also created a, GitHub repo that has all the code so, this is pretty much working right now, and you just have to add your config, file in there and you'll be good to go, and be able to do this as well, so let's dive into it as you can see, here we have a task running a lane chain, task send an email to me at Gmail and, then I describe it it's a pitch for why, you should visit star morph to get help, with GPT services for your business so, we can go ahead in our Jupiter Library, here and we can run all the cells, and as you can see right now I don't, have any new emails, and now we see the agent is crafting the, email, and I just got a notification, boom we just got an email written with, gpt3, it has a link to my website in it it, sent it to me but I could have ai you, know determine who that's sent to uh on, an email list or whatever and that's, just Gmail I mean we could do this with, slack we could do this with LinkedIn we, could do this with any of the 5 000 apps, that zapier has available you can create, a Google sheet now with gpt3 Facebook, integration so this is really Limitless, it's so easy to set up I mean there's, like 10 lines of code here I'm going to, give them all to you so this is super, exciting I'm excited to see what, everyone builds this is going to take, GPT Bots to the next level because now, they can interact with all these, services so anyway enough hype about it, let's talk about what exactly is, happening here and then how can you get, this set up, so uh first I'll start with explaining, and then then you'll understand easier, how to set up after we go through what's, happening here so we're using really, three tools here we're using open ai's, GPT completion we're using Lang chain, which is helping us interact with the, openai API and we're using zapier's new, natural language API that they just, released, natural language actions this is the, website here where you can request API, access and you should get it pretty much, immediately at least I got it the same, day, so this is the API that we're we're, working with, and so first we're just loading in all, of the libraries that we need we need, open AI we need Lane chain agents we, need the zapier integration built into, laying chain, I'm also using this library.env and that, allows us to import our API keys without, me statically coding it in here so, everyone can use my API key, and, then we are setting up the configuration, of the link chain agent in the lane, chain integration and then we can go, ahead and call our agent task and give, it a description in natural language, agent.run and that's where we type in, the description to write the email, and this is all in a Jupiter notebook, file which is like an interactive, um python, notebook and I'll leave a link to how, you can get set up with Jupiter it's, super easy you just run this in your, terminal and then you can run the, Jupiter lab command and it will launch, this here and I'm also going to provide, you this file to start with, um, so that's pretty basically pretty basic, how the small amount of code is able to, call this let's look at it a little more, from the zapier side of things so now, that I'm in the API, uh we can go ahead and manage our, actions and you do need to create one, action through their UI in order to get, I think your project ID to make this, work so make sure that you get your API, access you need to get your API key on, the last step there and then you want to, add in a new action and let's just go, through another action here just to, demonstrate more so instead of Gmail, let's do a, let's do a new Gmail because I already, have my Gmail, um, hooked up to it, so that's going to be simplest we'll, send a new email, we choose the account, and my account's already connected to, zapier okay, now this is very interesting you can, have a I guess these different forms, based on the prompt the natural language, that we give it in the notebook but I, want to send this specifically again to, me so just for testing purposes subject, have a I guess body have a I guess so, this is basically how I set up my last, action you click enable action, and now we can, call that from the Jupiter notebook that, we have set up so, um there's really not much more to it, you're just gonna put in this, configuration in this basic code and, you'll be able to interact with, um all of zapier's apps using natural, language, and most of this config code comes from, the documentation on Lang chain this is, their quick start guide as well as the, zapier API setup guide and like I said, I'm going to put this all in this GitHub, repo will be in the description it has, the Jupiter Library here, and it also has a readme telling you, what you need to install what the steps, are to get this running and some, resources in case you run into any, issues so I'm going to keep this one, quick but I hope you guys are with me on, how exciting this is because it's really, going to increase the functionality of, these GPT bots so very excited to see, I'm sure all of the amazing Engineers, out there that are keeping in touch with, all these new developments are going to, have stuff out tomorrow because that's, how fast it's going so very excited, about this thank you for watching the, video leave any questions or if you need, help with this reach out to us in the, description I'll leave a link to book a, free call with us thank you again for, watching and I'll see you in the next, video",
