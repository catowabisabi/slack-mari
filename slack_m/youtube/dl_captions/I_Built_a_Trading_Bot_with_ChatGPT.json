  "dialogue": "hello world it's siraj and I gave chat, GPT two thousand dollars to trade with, it's a trading bot that I built with, chat GPT and I want to show it to you in, this video GPT Trader that's what I'm, calling it once we log into this app we, can see that I've got the alpaca, dashboard and I'll explain this to you, later and it's using test data so using, test data I was able to make predictions, on different stocks including spy and, Nvidia and chat GPT helped me build this, bot now that's just using paper trading, let me show you how to use this with the, live trading and that's at the end of, the video did I make money with my two, thousand dollar investment or did I lose, money find out at the end so let's start, with our first question for chat GPT, what are the best techniques to be using, here so let's ask it that what are 10 of, the best machine learning techniques for, stock prediction let's see what it gives, us here, so it's going to list some techniques, and again we're Noob so we don't know, what all these things are you know I can, say you know random forests are the, ability to take decision trees which are, if then statements and then use them in, an ensemble or group method I can say XG, boost is a way of improving predictions, on the popular website kaggle I can say, that time series analysis that's a, technique to make predictions based on, past data that is spread out across the, time domain but the most popular one are, neural networks that's what everything, is based off of these days deep learning, so let's pick number six let's ask, chatgpt another question because, remember chat EBT unless unlike other, AIS is able to remember the context so, let's ask it the next question show me a, python web example of using a of using, that to predict the price of Yahoo stock, let's just pick a stock, and it's immediately going to do that it, knows that this is referring to a neural, network it knows that number six is, neural network and it knows to use the, Deep learning library scikit-learn with, Keras on top to do this now what's, happening here it's going to actually, tell us what's happening at the end but, I'll give you a little brief uh preview, of what's happening it's using the, scikit-learn library to make a, statistical model called a neural, network we can define a neural network, in seven words input times weight at a, bias activate it's a series of math, operations to make predictions Based on, data it's using the Yahoo data set of, past stock prices to do that now where, is it getting the CSV file the CSV file, is not coming from anywhere it's just, assuming that we have this data so what, we're going to have to do is we're going, to try to compile this in a in a code, window and see what this does for us and, as you can see it's telling us what this, code does so let's take all this code, we're going to hit copy okay and we're, going to go to our terminal window, and in our terminal window we're going, to, create a new folder, and in that folder we're going to create, a new file that's a python file we'll, call it stockprediction.pi, in stock prediction.pi we're going to, paste in the exact code that chat gbt, told us to and we're going to save it, and run it with the python command now, what do you think is going to happen any, guesses instead of just installing these, why don't we ask chatgpt for the, requirements file to install these what, are the requirements dot txt5 what does, the, requirements.txt file look like, look like for the previous code so all, those dependencies it's going to give it, to us look like for the previous code, and it's going to give us a, requirements.txt file and then all we, have to do is do pip install, requirements.txt and then we have all of, our dependencies right there so it's, going to tell us exactly how to do that, and we can just copy that create a new, requirements.txt and once we've done, that we can run that as a pip installs, pip install we're going to do it, recursively so all of them are going to, be installed no module named tensorflow, so I guess it's not perfect what we're, learning is that chat gbt clearly isn't, a perfect coder but it's giving us a, scaffolding here so we've got to install, tensorflow and there's a way to install, tensorflow but already off the bat we, know that this isn't going to work, because the data isn't legit so let's, ask chat CPT for a better data source, shall we and then we'll go back to this, code remember we're working with this, thing as a co-founder so our next step, is to say, is there some way to get the data what's, a good way to do this now I don't want, to pay for stock data I don't know about, you so the way to do that is to ask it, is there a zero commission that means a, way to trade stocks without paying money, is there a zero commission let's say, developer first sound like a ad Right, Now API for stocks and I also like, crypto so I'll say and crypto and let's, see what it gives us hopefully it gives, us one because I don't want to be too, complicated here and we're going to use, this API to get real-time data from the, web today of whatever stock we want and, it looks it says the alpaca trading API, so that's the one we're going to use, because chatgpt knows best doesn't it so, let's go to alpaca and see what how to, sign up for that now clearly I have, signed up for this and I've already, started making trades on the test, Network I've made a bunch of spy trades, and I made forty four dollars of profit, using you know 80 about 80 000 of fake, investment great job Suraj but better, job chat GPT I should be saying so once, we see that this this is cool we can, sign up for alpaca assume we've signed, up for alpaca and we've got the API keys, and that's what they're going to look, like right here they're going to look, like these API keys that you see here so, once we have the API keys for alpaca, we're going to want to get an example of, using it in Python right so we could go, through the docs and do that but better, than going through the docs let's just, ask chat GPT so thanks for showing me, that API show me an example of it, in Python and we're going to assume that, it has a python SDK for it oh great it, does the alpaca trading API in Python, perfect now remember the previous, example it showed us it gave us bad, stock data right it wasn't legit this is, going to give us real-time stock data, and as you can see by the parameters we, can Define what the start and end time, for this data is going to be so what, type of trading bot do I want I want a, trading bot that trades every 24 hours, it makes one trade every 24 hours based, on one data point and that data point is, a sharp ratio and it's computed using a, very modern technique but which, technique should we be using and I'll, tell you which technique which we should, be using in a second by asking chatgpt, but as you can see here it's given us a, simple example of using the alpaca API, to get a data feed so let's take this, data feed go back to our code and we're, going to add this to the top of our code, that means that first we're going to get, the data from alpaca then we're going to, use that scikit learn library with Keras, on top to train a very simple model a, statistical machine learning model on, that data but that's not going to be, enough right because if that it was that, easy everybody would be doing it so, let's first take this go back to our, code here we'll go to the stock, prediction code, and, we're going to just paste that in at the, bottom right under underneath what we, already have and we'll make sure to add, the import at the top so it looks really, cool we'll add our API key as well, remember we have our API because we, signed up for alpaca so we'll go back to, the dashboard we'll get that API key, there it is for the paper API and that, means that it's the one that's not, trading with real money that's what we, want right now as we're noobs we'll go, back to the code and replace that and, there we go now we have a python script, that's pulling real data, from the web we don't want to just use a, simple neural network we want to use, something awesome something's Cutting, Edge right what are the you know real, pros using here so what are we going to, ask it let's literally ask it what are, the most, Advanced neural network techniques to, use here, just what's going on Chachi BT what, should we be doing and it's going to, tell us all the different types of, neural networks to be using now in the, past five years we've seen so much, research and development in neural, network technology starting with, recurrent neural network which is what, you're seeing up here this is the idea, of taking the input at every previous, time step and putting it back into the, network at each recurring time step, hence the word recurrence that offered a, lot of progress in terms of predictions, for time series data so did variants of, recurrent networks like long short-term, memory networks so did gated recurrent, units Gru networks so when we take the, idea of a transformer Network and we, combine it with reinforcement learning, what do we get, that's right deep reinforcement learning, and that's what we want to use so we're, going to take this idea of reinforcement, learning and this idea of a neural, network that it also has given us and, we're going to combine it with our own, domain knowledge of this idea of a, domain specific reinforcement learning, technique called Deep reinforcement, learning so what does that look like in, Python right that's a very abstract, example and the way to, look at that in Python is to say well, okay what are some of the most popular, reinforcement learning techniques, and it's going to tell us all of them, it's going to start with uh proximal, policy optimization it's going to or Q, learning actually and then it's going to, move to proximal policy optimization and, some other one sarsa so we don't know, what a lot of these acronyms are and a, lot of reinforcement learning is, essentially a series of acronyms now, policy gradients as you see here is a, variant of proximal policy optimization, which I know is a really good technique, just from the literature that I've been, looking at on the internet so there we, go number six so we're going to take, number six which looks totally, hard to understand unless you're a total, expert at this and that's the one we're, going to pick so we're going to pick, this super Advanced technique that chat, topt just gave us and we're going to say, okay please explain PPO please explain, number six to me like I'm a, five-year-old, oh and show me some python code for it, okay so that's it okay perfect so it's, going to tell us it's a way to teach a, computer to make decisions like a human, and so just with that I get a very basic, idea of what's Happening here it is, trying to find the average between two, various maximal points it's trying to, find the optimal area between two ranges, in two different directions of whatever, your policy is in this case the policy, is going to be to find the right stock, picks at the right time so it's already, given us an example using stable, Baseline stable baselines is open ai's, own library for reinforcement learning, and it's using in three lines of code, the proximal policy algorithm on a, environment that is has nothing to do, with stock prices so we want to replace, it with a stock price environment so, let's go to GitHub and we'll type in, stable baselines we're going to type in, not just stable Baseline but open AI, because openai made stable baselines and, we'll type in financial just to see if, we can find anything that's Financial, related and under code and it turns out, that if we just type in that the first, result is going to be this fin RL, Library by the AI for finance Foundation, very cool stuff under examples they have, a an IPython notebook that shows how to, use deep reinforcement learning on, real-time data to make predictions so, let's go to that demo by using what, openai told us it's what chat GPT told, us it said use reinforcement learning, use proximal policy optimization and, here's a python example but there's not, an exact way to do that using the, existing codes we're going to take a, little detour here and use this library, right here finrl to make those, predictions so let's open that up in our, own collab notebook and as you can see, I've opened it up right here now what, this is going to do let's go through, this step by step the first thing it's, going to do is going to install this, repository into the browser after it's, installed its dependencies and you can, see a lot of code here then it's going, to create some folders to save all of, this data as it trains on, once it's pulled the data now how is it, pulling the data what it's using right, here is the Yahoo downloader so it's, pulling data in re from whatever date, ranges we choose but we're going to, switch that with the alpaca API once, it's pulled that data it's going to show, it in terms of all of the variables that, are a part of that data and it's going, to find 30 days of stock data for all 30, of these tickers from Apple all the way, down to the Dow and then it's going to, add what are called technical indicators, to those uh rows so all of those single, stocks are also going to have these very, popular technical indicators which are, known in the community, once it has their technical indicators, then we're going to create a Markov, decision process what is a Markov, decision process this is a this is an, idea in reinforcement learning where you, have an agent in an environment and it, takes a step at every given time step a, Markov decision process is a way to, frame this process in such a way that it, is mathematically possible to define a, policy that means how should this agent, be acting at every time step and so what, is the policy for us the agent first of, all is going to be this AI that is a, neural network specifically a proximal, policy optimization neural network and, the environment is the financial Market, what this library is going to do is it's, going to pull that real-time data into a, simulated environment train this deep, reinforcement learning agent in that, simulated environment and then use the, alpaca API to make real trades based on, the output of that every single day I, will then deploy that to the web and, it's going to run every single day for, me okay so that's what's happening here, I'm defining the variables for this deep, reinforcement learning Ensemble agent so, it's actually running three different, strategies a2c PPO and ddpg now remember, chat GPT showed us what those, reinforcement learning strategies were, okay so once it's trained and you can, see all this training data it's going to, show a back test and what a back test is, is it's a way for an automated system, without biases to make predictions based, on previous data now you and I we can't, do that because we're biased we would, just pick if we already know what it's, going to be what the price could be but, as you can see here on this test that I, ran earlier, you can see that the green line is the, actual values and the gray line is the, return that our bot made so that means, that on that data it made it returned, better than the market so now it's up to, us do we want to use that to buy and, it's always going to change right based, on every day if if a given day is two, percent profit do I want to buy or do I, want to sell what I'm going to do is I'm, going to Define a threshold and I'm, going to say if the sharp ratio is above, say 0.4 in this case I'm just randomly, saying a number go ahead and buy Nvidia, stock if it's not, sell and that's it and I want to let, that run for five days and it's just, going to run on a web app so that's the, idea do we have anything else to ask, chat GPT we have this thing uh oh yeah, we need to add the alpaca API to it and, you can see it right here so this is, going to make trades based on the bot, okay so let's connect the bot that's, already trained to the alpaca API so, with this single function it can make, that trade with one function, programmatically given the secret and, the public key, so what is our web app even doing well, it's running a collab notebook once a, day from start to finish at a given, interval that's it and then it's going, to make a trade if that reinforcement, learning library says to make a trade so, how do I get it to do that well we need, to run what's called a Cron job so let's, ask trap GPT what that is and then how, to do that so let's say I want to run, this AI trading bot once a day, the way to do that, is with a Cron job apparently because, Raj said so right is with a Cron job, what is a Cron job and write me one in, flask in Python flask because I want, this to be a flask API in Python flask, to deploy to versal which is my favorite, deployment platform, um, and it runs once a day it just runs a, Google collab once a day, that's it, a Cron job is a scheduled task that runs, automatically at specified intervals on, a Linux or Unix based system perfect, that's exactly what we wanted so it's, telling us how to run this with the, python code so, with this single class file of code we, can ask versal to run this collab, notebook once a day at every you know at, 8 AM let's say 8 A.M, and it's going to buy the stock and then, it's gonna if it's good enough right if, the AI agent if the PPO agent has a, predicts a sharp ratio that is above my, threshold then it will buy else it will, hold and if it's below a certain ratio, it will sell let's say 0.2 so 0.4 is the, upper threshold and 0.2 is a minimum, threshold so that's the script and we're, going to deploy it to Virtual with, terminal so I'm going to take that go, back to my code that was hosted locally, and I'm going to deploy this with my, white labeled uh Firebase, starter package here that you guys can, find on my GitHub by the way gbt Trader, make it whatever you want but it's got, Firebase and everything integrated so, that's that's how this is going to work, I'm going to take it deploy to Virtual, and right now I have deposited money, into my Live account but I'm still, waiting on that deposit so once that, deposit is complete I'm gonna let the, bot make a trade and I'm going to come, back in 24 hours and let's see how much, money it's made all right here we go, okay it's been 24 hours and after, investing over two thousand dollars it's, made four trades and made a total of, 1.62 profit not bad thank you guys so, much for watching subscribe if you liked, the video hit that like button it really, helps promote the video and for now I've, got to go catch GPT myself so thanks for, watching, [Music]",
